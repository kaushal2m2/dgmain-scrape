It has better tab management. For example, it can open every address entered in a new tab rather than the current tab and you can get it open new tabs to right of the current tab. Also, it is based on newer builds of Chromium than Brave is.

Reasons: 
There is no trained helper for Linux based malware removal in this forum. That means no one here can assist you, but people might still be able to answer to your more general question.
Farbar is not suitable for Linux malware removal, even if it ran, e.g., with Wine, it will look for Windows specific autostart locations which do not exist on Linux.

I will compose a more general answer later today, when I got some more time."

What's your distro? How did you know that you have a remote access trojan on your linux distro? Do you have iptables switched on? ( like ubuntu have apps like ufw/gufw as the front end for iptable, which when switched on can block incoming connections not originated from your pc). What router do you have? Most low end internet service provider's supplied routers never gets updated and can become part of botnets. For the sake of safety, disconnect your LAN, switch off all iot devices, switch off your router, if possible reset and update firmware, reset your bios, boot from a dvd (don't use bootable usb) of your preffered linux distro, remove all partitions , recreate all partitions, then install your distro and if possible encrypt your drive ( I would prefer a distro with drive encryption capability, pop os provides an option to encrypt the entire drive), enable the iptable firewall after install. Use nextdns system wide and use TLS Dns encryption ( you can edit ""systemd-resolved"" file to add ip address for Next dns, information is available on nextdns settings page, you can use ""sudo gedit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf"" command to get graphical editing of the system file.). You can alternatively use Safing Portmaster to control apps on your linux distro. Connect to the net only after doing these steps.

This is more common if you have purchased a used device rather than new.

THANKS !","Guys,sorry for my late reply.
But i had no internet until today ( i think that the RAT have option to stop my internet).
At the moment i use Gentoo.
I know that my pc is infected with RAT,because my pc is doing strange things like example :
-stop my internet
-stop apps
-100 % have and keylogger,because some of my passwords were changed
-sometimes my mouse is moving over my desktop
-my dvd writer just opens without i touch anything
-etc etc

I have tryed to do a low level format and then i flashed my BIOS.
But the virus still remains.
The problem is that all my devices are now hacked ... and even an firewall can't catch them.
What you can suggest me to do?
@The_King how to dump the BIOS/Firmware and where to scan it? THANKS!"

THANKS !","If it were me, I would be inclined to physically remove the hard drive and attach it to another computer (perhaps a Windows machine ) as an external drive. I would then reformat the drive using the second computer and run a malware scan on it.

Thats what I would try first personally, although if the firmware of the drive has been compromised, it may be that a more complex solution is needed. Others who are more knowledgeable than me have commented on that approach.

But if this computer is your main device, you might just want to buy a new hard drive. They are cheap enough these days. I‘d seriously consider that option. 

Before I did any of the above I would use a clean device (such as a phone) to update the passwords for my email accounts and anything else that might be important. And make sure two factor authentication is switched on. Perhaps ask for replacement payment cards if you have used any on the infected machine."

There can be several possibilities, for example:

Infected router.
Infected Bios/UEFI.
Infected SPI Flash.
Bad USB.
Another infected computer in the local network.
The infected neighborhood network (Emotet).
Local Hacker.
Points 1,4,5 and 6, 7 can be temporarily prevented by disconnecting the machine from the network for some time and not using external devices. I would also disconnect all internal drives and try to install a new system from the DVD on the completely new hard drive. Next, you should observe the system for a couple of days and scan against malware via Kaspersky Live CD created and updated on some clean machine.
The problems related to points 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are other stories."

4.I always use DVD disks made from clean pc only.
5.BTW all my devices are now hacked with this virus
6.I never open mail attachments/files from untrusted people.

Most of these problems can be explained by old hardware, unstable linux distro (when you tweak it too much, it's not as stable anymore, makes the apps/OS crash), bad ISP (internet stops working suddenly and then after few secs it works. This reminds me of my last ISP, it was hell).
Not saying your system is clean but I have seen these things happen on my old desktop, turns out it had faulty power supply, everything including mouse & keyboard would go wonky for a few secs every hour and back to normal. I would take the system to a PC repair shop first just to eliminate the boring stuff out.
Also websites get hacked all the time which might explain why some of your passwords were changed (check your hacked credentials here). This is why 2FA is important, and don't reuse the same password on other websites."

2 The slow delivery of email messages is probably a different issue, it is probably caused by overload on the chinese servers.

User can choose what to harden/block easily via (yes, 100+) checkboxes, once an option is checked nothing more is needed (something like group policy editor?).

This allows a company/user to harden specific areas as needed, such as block scripts, block commonly abused system processes (powershell, cmd,...), child processes of a parent process, processes on specific locations, processes signed with an invalid/expired/revoked certificate and much more, possibilities are really a lot.

Using custom block rules companies/users can block any process behaviour they want with very simple and smart custom rules.

OSA also has pre-defined protection profiles like Basic, Medium, Advanced, Extreme that requires only one-click of the mouse.

OSA is focused in hardening the system and blocking malware delivery methods, and is very strong and effective in doing so.




VS blocks by context and OS Armor blocks by file type. There is a HUGE difference between the two.
I have said this a million times... please understand that blocking something by file type is really, really, really stupid.

Click to expand...


OSA blocks a process based on its behaviour, not by file type...

OSA analyzes many aspects of a process (parent process, command-line, location, file type, contest, permissions, hash, risk score, and much much more) using our own algorithms.

With OSA you can configure a system using a zero trust strategy: block any process (unsigned processes, unknown signers, etc) except what you know/trust.

Thank you for joining the conversation!

How do users automagically guess which cyber attack they are going to experience, so they know which boxes to check?

There are some OSA rules that are based on behavior, but a lot of the rules (that are going to actually be enforced) specifically block by file type, or in a lot of cases simply by file.

Processes can either be used for good, or they can be used for bad. Globally blocking anything by file type without context is very stupid.

Here is one of many examples...

If I check the OSA rule ""Block execution of .cmd scripts"", then all cmd scripts are blocked, even if they are necessary and benign. In my opinion, the best way to handle this rule is to include context, so that it is blocked when it needs to be blocked, and auto allowed when it needs to be allowed. For example, if a non-risky whitelisted app launches a cmd script, should it be blocked or not? With OSA, it is blocked either way, without context.

Simply blocking ""unsigned processes, unknown signers"", etc, is NOT zero trust. Sure, OSA will harden the system to a certain extent, but it is far from zero trust."

"Jun 26, 2022",Q&A - Master password idea,"Hey, everyone.

I spent some time thinking what is the best way to remember a master password without writing it down.

The thing that works best for me is to find a painting that I like or am familiar with, and remember the name of the painting, the painter and the year (you can add medium, period and place if you wish so to make your password longer/ stronger).

If I think that I might forget my password I can print the painting on a paper and put it where I want, on a wall, in a book, etc. as a reminder.

Now, for demonstration purposes I made an example of what that password would look like, this is done in KeePassXC password manager:

Password: beheading of saint john the baptist caravaggio
Password quality: Excellent
Entropy: 105.58bit

I find it really convenient to use a passphrase, instead to type random characters that would take much longer for me.
Now, you don't have to use a painting, you could use a movie/ tv show dialog that is reasonably long and memorable and print that scene as a reminder (without everyone knowing the context of it).

What do you think, is it a good idea, would you try it? Оr is it not convenient, secure, too much hassle?
What would you add or change?","One of the better password practices is to use passphrases. You can generate one from a list, then only bots or people can guess if they got that same list or words are part of their list(s). Or you can do it the way you do it, which is even better. The key point from passphrases is that they are more memorable then random generation, spaces where accepted (not all services do) just make it that much harder to guess where the space is. Add some odd numbers and either 1 or 2 signs in it and you're golden. Just don't do common tricks like replacing E for a 3, A for an 4 etc.. And avoid adding them at the end (and beginning) of your passphrase.

You can replace one space for such a thing or randomly add them to one of the words in the middle etc... What you described is one of the better practices for any password. However random generation (example between quotes: ""AH*Jjs5623!@)4"") just make it more convenient for people. As those generators have been around for nearly 2 decades and have no real change in the meantime.

Making it more usable for password managers that either generate them automatically or the user not having to think about it. One other tip is that if or when you turn a moment or a hobby or anything else close to you to a passphrase. Try to avoid everyday things (for you and not in generally everyday object) for both your sanity and your predictability, in the rare off-chance that someone (or a bot alghoritm is programmed) is targeting you in specific. In that event try to keep it at things that can be easily dismissed as ""too abstract to be it"".

However, in general. You already had the right idea from the start.

My only concern with this approach is that ""themes"" can lead to guessable passwords if someone has cracked one or knows your algorithm. The number of famous paintings that a non art geek remembers is probably up in the 1000 range, which makes it vulnerable to a dictionary attack. This is especially deadly if, for example, you use one of these passwords at a website that doesn't hash their passwords and your password leaks online. If I saw a password like this, the first thing I'd do is build a dictionary attack out of Wikipedia lists of paintings  

Finally, I find that words are more ""glanceable"" than random passwords. You can try this yourself -- give yourself a half second glimpse of a phrase password versus a half second glimpse of a random alphanumeric password. The human brain seems to read words quicker and remember them better, and that can work against you if you accidentally reveal a password to someone by pressing the wrong button on a web form, for example (Amazon's app is infamous for having a checkbox under the password field that says ""Show password"", when most people expect ""Remember my password"")

But yeah, it could be a great password scheme, just keep it to yourself and don't let anyone else know."

Yeah, I think I understood everything you said. The thing with this kind of password is that I only use it as my master password for KeePassXC database which is an offline manager. I don't use a sync option or store my master password online, like for example Bitwarden does. So the only way to crack my database is to brake into my house, given that someone targeted me for whatever specific reason at all. And I doubt there is any. 

As for many sites that I have an account for, I use the integrated generator and don't use less than 25 characters (depends on the site), including all king of character types, using copy-paste method, so I don't have to remember random 30 character passwords for 30+ sites."

No need to do anything with the images in this thread as I already fixed them.

A small tip/hint while you and your friends waits for the help from the IT staff, try use a VPN.

","Thank you everyone for your response. There are three points I noted from them and under their permission of course.

1. The incident was caused by outdated or malicious web plugin(s) used on login page . This part is too technical, I have no idea what they said. I heard ""injeksi kode jarak-jauh"" remote code injection (?).
2. A serious security measures by purchasing Fortinet or Trend Micro.

A firewall may be able to block attacks on the network level, but if one of the users receives a fake document that is actually some type of ransomware and runs it, then even the best firewall can't stop the encryption process. A firewall can block malicious connections from and to a malicious actor, but there are types of malware that don't need to connect to a C&C server at all. So in short, a firewall shouldn't function as a standalone security tool."

I would recommend that you contact your hosting provider and ask for their help because to remove malware from a site you need admin rights. Also, you should look at your site source code to find out what was exploited and what malicious files are used in this attack.
Did you scan your site to see if there's actual malware on the site or if that warning message is because of the content of the site? Do you see that message on all the pages of your site, or only on specific ones. 

Also, it would be a good idea to check the Google Search Console > Security Issues section as there you may find additional details. More details here: Social engineering (phishing and deceptive sites) | Documentation | Google Developers

Hello @Jack and @SecureKongo,

Thanks for the reply. I first knew about it because when I opened my website, it got redirected to a suspicious link, and I couldn't access my website. I also couldn't access the WordPress dashboard. I have contacted my hosting provider and asked them to do a full account scan. Two viruses were found, and I followed the guidance to remove the virus. They also helped restore my account using backup before the occurrence, but the problem persisted.

My hosting provider also suggested replacing the default WordPress files which I had also done. I also removed some files and folders with suspicious names. When I opened my website again, I could access the homepage. I could also access the WordPress dashboard. But whenever I clicked on any post, it got redirected again.

I also scanned my website using Quttera Online Website Malware Scanner. There were many files detected as infected by a trojan. I have removed the script that was pointed out as malicious. This is the script that I removed from many js files :





Another full account scan has been done by my hosting account provider, and the result shows that the viruses have been successfully removed. But the posts on my website are still inaccessible.

I tried to check the database and found this script on some rows:




I have deleted all of those scripts I could find. But now, every time I try to click on any post on my websites, I still get this notification







Before asking for the full account scan, I checked on the google search console, and the result was clean. I checked on Sucuri before, and there was malware found on the website. But the last scan showed no malware found, though the site is still blacklisted.

This is the current result from virustotal scanner :





and this one from urlvoid





Here's the last external monitoring scan report from Quttera











I tried to find the redirected link in the database and Cpanel files, but I couldn't find anything. I would very much appreciate it if someone could help me fix this issue."

Thank you","Hello Everyone, 

Just want to let you all know that I have sorted out the problem. Apparently, there was more of this script in the database than what I had found before. 



The filtering row didn't catch it. So I went to a deeper search and found that the script was injected at the end of every single of my post. Now they all have been successfully removed from the database and my website has become accessible again. 

I have also run a scan with Wordfence on my WordPress Dashboard and repaired/removed all the files that were flagged as an issue. So far it seems to work well and hopefully will continue this way.

I'm not sure if there is still an issue that needs to be taken care of. Based on a scan from sucuri, and internal monitoring from Quttera, the website is now clean and I no longer get a warning notification from my browser when accessing the website. However, scan results from virustotal and urlvoid remain the same as before. I guess for now I will just let it be while keeping a close eye on my website."

"Apr 27, 2022",Terrible Penetration Testing Companies,"I usually just read articles but never post but I felt like I had to on this one about this scam/poser of a company called redbot security. I'm fairly new to my company and recently, my boss had a pentest performed and he searched for a pentesting company on Google and one of the first selections that came up was ""redbot security."" Never really heard of them and at the time, I didn't have a say in his choice or even knew he was choosing a company for a pentest. I guess at first glance to my boss, Redbot Security seemed like a legitimate pentesting company but what I found out was quite concerning.

So the first page on Google had this company but the site was just a blog post about the best / top rated pentest company and of course, it is was Redbot Security's own blog post. (red flag)









Top Ranked Penetration Testing List. Best Pentesting Companies in U.S.


List of Top Rated Penetration Testing Companies in US with cost comparison. Choose the Best Penetration Testing Company for your project.




redbotsecurity.com





How original. Looking at this post I realized that it was just a blog post with every imaginable keyword related to penetration testing, etc etc. For example, ""Important Penetration Testing Checklist when searching for the Best Penetration Testing Company for your Project."" I also realized now after getting various Statement of Work (SOW) documents and quotes from other companies that Redbot uses a lot of wording from other companies. For example, when they describe their toolsets, in their ""Redbot Security Featured Penetration Testing Services: Internal Penetration Testing"", it was a word-for-word copy of Rapid7's wording with what tools they use. Weird?

Ok, so looking further in their blog post is about their certifications? Looks like they just listed every type they could find and some aren't even certs. What about their LinkedIn? Well, come to find out, just a few real profiles and for pentesters, ALL FAKE. For example:

Security Solutions Architect at Redbot Security

Sr. Cyber Security Consultant at Redbot Security

Engineering Group - Private-Redbot Security

Pentester Group at Redbot Security

All of the above are ""private"" but with a little magic with LinkedIn and Google, I can see what their profiles are or who is in the groups and guess what? All bogus.

Yea, these are fake profiles. So then I started using LinkedIn more and got some odd/interesting facts when doing some reverse imaging and searches about these people to include ones that did work for them. Well for one, the only pentester I saw wasn't even an employee with Redbot, he works elsewhere and he seems to only be a contractor for redbot security. There is a female who works at a different company and only seems to be a contractor with them. Odd, because on the phone, they made it sound like they had 20 or 30 people on their pentesting team.

Seems that they wanted to hide the fact of how small they are. Then, if that wasn't enough, I thought, ""hey maybe we'll get a good pentest still."" NOPE. Nothing. They did a web app pentest for us after charging top dollar and guess what they found. Tons of things. How many of those things were real? Zero. All false positives. Looks like they just ran an automated scan and not even a good one and we got this giant scan output that they called a report. Then worse yet, we later got compromised because they told us everything is good-to-go. And to think we were charged top dollar by these clowns.

What a bunch of scammers. I'm itching to just call them up and ask for a copy of all of their certs they listed just to watch them spin in circles over it. And think about this, they say they ""specialize"" in OT/SCADA networks for energy companies. No wonder they are getting hacked.","""he searched for a pentesting company on Google""

"Apr 17, 2022",Q&A - Are third party consumer AVs a dying market?,"Mergers from Norton, Windows Defender advancing, Windows 11 implementing a host of security features.... what is the future of consumer third party AVs?

For consumers, ...the AV industry has been suffering for years due to a host of reasons (from my bird's eye view). Windows Defender advancing and coming pre-installed as default is a big one. Usage patterns changing to mobile and tablets (safer forms of computing with tight app ecosystems. Pushing people to Appstore's that are heavily vetted). 2FA and Password managers (and requirements) ...securing accounts more safely.

Back in the early days of XP and Windows 7, there was good money to be made cleaning infected consumer PCs. I'd say the main reasons why would be:

1. Wider usage of Windows Desktops/Laptops in the early days, 2005-2012ish (vs. now...phones with their secure app ecosystem).
2. AVs needed to be installed. There was no built-in Windows Defender. Most people expired their subscription and never renewed (so no protection whatsoever).
3. Torrents were rampant back in those days (Limewire, Piratebay, etc.). Cracked software, music, videos, etc.
4. Patching software or OS was not as automatic as it is today.
5. Malware and Adware (which was a nightmare), wasn't as ""targeted"" as it is today. It was rampant all over.
6. Cloud detection could have changed the way malware was spread (more targeted to avoid immediate detection).
7. Probably a million other reasons (comment below please).

So, saying all that, the AV industry did suffer when Windows Defender decided to go full default protection. There was a big backlash when that happened (I remember Kaspersky was one that didn't like it. They called it ""monopolizing AVs"". Did Kaspersky see the 1st nail being hammered in the coffin?). The consumer AV industry seemed to shift to useless ""cleaning products, ID theft monitoring (that tries to again, sell you products if you call their service center), etc."". Trying to scrape up every penny they can.

I don't know anything about enterprise, but on the consumer side...there is very little money to be made cleaning PCs with malware. It just doesn't happen anymore on the scale it use to.

When Windows 8.1 - Windows 10 was released, consumer Malware infection rates plummeted to almost nothing (except the emergence of ransomware...which still wasn't as widespread as the XP/7 days of malware/adware).

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we need complex hardware firewalls, segregated networks, layered protection (default deny, solid third party AVs, etc.), and 2nd opinion scanners as consumers.

Or maybe just Windows 10 or 11 (patched), with Windows Defender (I'm using Defender as status quo), and safe computing habits will keep us ""squeaky clean""...because the malware ""Boogie Man"" is just not as big of a threat to consumers as he use to be (Many third party AVs want you to believe otherwise...because they have to ""sell sell sell FEAR"").

So, the elephant in the room is: Are we still clinging to the old days when we actually needed third party AVs? Second opinion scanners? (Those became super popular during horrid days of malware ... and made some $ for techs willing to hustle and scan).

Just my opinion. Sorry for the long rant. Smarter people than me, please chime in. Thanks for reading ","Third party AVs for home users are focusing on providing additional/extra features, such as VPN, junk file cleaner, and identity monitoring and protection, which can set them apart from built-in Defender from the vendor's perspective. However, these features are generally useless and make the product bloatware from the users' perspective.

Third-party AV vendors may eventually find the enterprise sector to be more profitable."

The sector does seem to be tightening, with Norton gobbling up the competition. Vendors are being bought out, because consumers don't find value there were it once was.

But the main point I was trying to drive home is (outside of features), are we pushing people incorrectly...when we say: F-secure is awsome, Kaspersky is the best, Norton is trash, etc. Does it really matter? Do we really need to nick pick over 99% to 100% detection rates?"

The consumer AV industry seemed to shift to useless ""cleaning products, ID theft monitoring (that tries to again, sell you products if you call their service center), etc."". Trying to scrape up every penny they can.

I don't know anything about enterprise, but on the consumer side...there is very little money to be made cleaning PCs with malware. It just doesn't happen anymore on the scale it use to.

When Windows 8.1 - Windows 10 was released, consumer Malware infection rates plummeted to almost nothing (except the emergence of ransomware...which still wasn't as widespread as the XP/7 days of malware/adware).

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we need complex hardware firewalls, segregated networks, layered protection (default deny, solid third party AVs, etc.), and 2nd opinion scanners as consumers.

Or maybe just Windows 10 or 11 (patched), with Windows Defender (I'm using Defender as status quo), and safe computing habits will keep us ""squeaky clean""...because the malware ""Boogie Man"" is just not as big of a threat to consumers as he use to be (Many third party AVs want you to believe otherwise...because they have to ""sell sell sell FEAR"").

So, the elephant in the room is: Are we still clinging to the old days when we actually needed third party AVs? Second opinion scanners? (Those became super popular during horrid days of malware ... and made some $ for techs willing to hustle and scan).

Just my opinion. Sorry for the long rant. Smarter people than me, please chime in. Thanks for reading ","I use a third party antivirus because it is lighter than Defender and more configurable, not for better protection. In terms of protection, I feel that Microsoft Defender is fine for the majority of users. If you don't need extra functionality and Defender is not slowing down your computer, then I don't think there's any need to use a different AV."
"Apr 17, 2022",Q&A - Are third party consumer AVs a dying market?,"Mergers from Norton, Windows Defender advancing, Windows 11 implementing a host of security features.... what is the future of consumer third party AVs?

For consumers, ...the AV industry has been suffering for years due to a host of reasons (from my bird's eye view). Windows Defender advancing and coming pre-installed as default is a big one. Usage patterns changing to mobile and tablets (safer forms of computing with tight app ecosystems. Pushing people to Appstore's that are heavily vetted). 2FA and Password managers (and requirements) ...securing accounts more safely.

Back in the early days of XP and Windows 7, there was good money to be made cleaning infected consumer PCs. I'd say the main reasons why would be:

1. Wider usage of Windows Desktops/Laptops in the early days, 2005-2012ish (vs. now...phones with their secure app ecosystem).
2. AVs needed to be installed. There was no built-in Windows Defender. Most people expired their subscription and never renewed (so no protection whatsoever).
3. Torrents were rampant back in those days (Limewire, Piratebay, etc.). Cracked software, music, videos, etc.
4. Patching software or OS was not as automatic as it is today.
5. Malware and Adware (which was a nightmare), wasn't as ""targeted"" as it is today. It was rampant all over.
6. Cloud detection could have changed the way malware was spread (more targeted to avoid immediate detection).
7. Probably a million other reasons (comment below please).

Apart from that with the inception of secure browsers like chrome, edge etc phishing and infection from net too have reduced considerably. But on the other hand, if you can compramise an Android/ iOS device it will hurt and there is a lot at stake. So most malware makers are now concentrating on those sectores. I live in India and I can see a huge increase in financial fraud by making fraud phone call, identifying as bank call centre employee and asking for credit card/ debit card information, taking advantage of uninformed people, all these requires no programming capabilities and promises easy money.

I don't know anything about enterprise, but on the consumer side...there is very little money to be made cleaning PCs with malware. It just doesn't happen anymore on the scale it use to.

When Windows 8.1 - Windows 10 was released, consumer Malware infection rates plummeted to almost nothing (except the emergence of ransomware...which still wasn't as widespread as the XP/7 days of malware/adware).

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we need complex hardware firewalls, segregated networks, layered protection (default deny, solid third party AVs, etc.), and 2nd opinion scanners as consumers.

Or maybe just Windows 10 or 11 (patched), with Windows Defender (I'm using Defender as status quo), and safe computing habits will keep us ""squeaky clean""...because the malware ""Boogie Man"" is just not as big of a threat to consumers as he use to be (Many third party AVs want you to believe otherwise...because they have to ""sell sell sell FEAR"").

So, the elephant in the room is: Are we still clinging to the old days when we actually needed third party AVs? Second opinion scanners? (Those became super popular during horrid days of malware ... and made some $ for techs willing to hustle and scan).

Just my opinion. Sorry for the long rant. Smarter people than me, please chime in. Thanks for reading ","3rd party AVs are essentially dead on all operating systems other than Windows. Almost all major browsers come with malware protection/scanning built-in. The most important change however, in my opinion, is that people simply download less content. We stream or download from highly controlled DRM sources (App store, Play store). That has reduced the demand for AVs especially on mobile devices."
"Apr 17, 2022",Q&A - Are third party consumer AVs a dying market?,"Mergers from Norton, Windows Defender advancing, Windows 11 implementing a host of security features.... what is the future of consumer third party AVs?

For consumers, ...the AV industry has been suffering for years due to a host of reasons (from my bird's eye view). Windows Defender advancing and coming pre-installed as default is a big one. Usage patterns changing to mobile and tablets (safer forms of computing with tight app ecosystems. Pushing people to Appstore's that are heavily vetted). 2FA and Password managers (and requirements) ...securing accounts more safely.

Back in the early days of XP and Windows 7, there was good money to be made cleaning infected consumer PCs. I'd say the main reasons why would be:

1. Wider usage of Windows Desktops/Laptops in the early days, 2005-2012ish (vs. now...phones with their secure app ecosystem).
2. AVs needed to be installed. There was no built-in Windows Defender. Most people expired their subscription and never renewed (so no protection whatsoever).
3. Torrents were rampant back in those days (Limewire, Piratebay, etc.). Cracked software, music, videos, etc.
4. Patching software or OS was not as automatic as it is today.
5. Malware and Adware (which was a nightmare), wasn't as ""targeted"" as it is today. It was rampant all over.
6. Cloud detection could have changed the way malware was spread (more targeted to avoid immediate detection).
7. Probably a million other reasons (comment below please).

So, saying all that, the AV industry did suffer when Windows Defender decided to go full default protection. There was a big backlash when that happened (I remember Kaspersky was one that didn't like it. They called it ""monopolizing AVs"". Did Kaspersky see the 1st nail being hammered in the coffin?).

Probably the former, seeing as I and likely countless others only utilize Microsoft Defender (although admittedly I'm using modified settings, but am absolutely sure nothing would change if I used default settings) and remain uninfected. 
I think most people would be better served changing their browsing habits rather than investing in a third-party AV or security suite. 

Ultimately though, third-party AVs provide competition, which is always a good thing. I wouldn't want to live in a world where Microsoft Defender is the only option."

You don't need to remember passwords, use something like keepass or bitwarden and remember only one password ( ie for bitwarden or keepass) and use different passwords for each and every website, in that way even if one of your password gets compromised it will not produce a cascading effect on your security.

"Apr 13, 2022",Q&A - Is this a good idea for password?,"Hello. I am wondering if a password is composed from mathematical expression, equation, or symbols is considered safe. I have tested this password and it seems resistant to brute force attack. I don't really like the use of password generator because it's hard to remember the generated password.

This is the example of math-based password I created, (I can change multiple parameters, of course). It's a differential equation, but I can take another inspiration from other areas of math. It's complicated, but it's very easy for me to remember.





I really want to know if this is a good idea from a computer security perspective. Thanks!","Most people around me use 8 digits passwords and, often, the same one for many apps. But they also have Apple devices with double authentication. Face ID or Touch ID. No issues in the last 5 years. For newbies, it is easy to get a secure environment in Apple devices.
A friend of mine with a PC got infected last summer. I was able to get him to use KeePass, reinforced his passwords to 12 digits, installed Configure Defender to harden Microsoft Defender and AdGuard in Chrome. So far, so good. I didn't set double authentication on his PC because he lives in another country 6 months in a year and if he has an issue, he won't be able to solve it."

Thanks!

PS: Now after I rescanned on virustotal last 2 links with magazinulupeste it found something different. First time it found 1 malicious and 1 phising but now only suspicious. Its strange I dont know why.
If im searching on google and I copy the link it says (virus) that is Malicious (Sophos) and Phishing (Avira) but when I copy the link from history it says suspicious even it is the same.","Hello,
I see these are all websites where you can buy stuff. In this case, fishing stuff. 
In this case it's a bit more difficult to find out if they are fake offers, because I don't speak the language and don't know the currency.
That's where you come in: Is the website known in your country? Does it have spelling mistakes? Is there an imprint? You can also Google ""domain.com is it fake?"" or simply check if there are any reviews for this website. Are the prices perhaps too good to be true? Then it is definitely a fraudulent website. 

I would only be most sure about www.totalfishing.ro. For example, they have a Facebook page that has existed since 2011 and has many followers who also comment on the posts. They also have an Instagram page with lots of photos. I don't think scammers would make so much effort.

Ditto... although now that Avast is owned by Norton I seem to be repeating my error  Fortunately after first infection I switched to Avira (& others) and haven't been hit by viruses, since... or at least none that I'm aware of. My daughters' laptops which were mainly used for games & messenger/forums back then slowly ground to a halt under the weight of malware which got past Norton 360 so a clean install, new AV & passwords were necessary. With kids you have to assume they'll click 'okay' to everything so set AV to strictest level possible and if it's important they can ask for help if they're blocked."

What's your story?","Way back when, probably around 2000, I installed Tiny Personal Firewall. Not the Tiny of today, but another, earlier Tiny that ran on Win 98 up to I think Windows 2000. Well, the version I had was Tiny v2. In the early 2000s, they came out with Tiny Personal 4, which had all kinds of boxes to check for configuration. I figured, knowing about as much about firewalls as I do today, the more boxes checked, the more secure my computer would be.

It worked. When I finished checking a large number of the little boxes, I had to reboot. Well, I rebooted and couldn't get into my computer. That told me Tiny worked. My computer was safe, even from me. I ended up having to grab my stack of 3 1/2 inch floppies and reinstall Win 98. I did not reinstall Tiny Personal Firewall, settling instead on the free version of Sygate firewall, which I ran until Comodo came on the scene."

I then proceeded to taunt the hacker to keep him busy and helped my brother get his account back, all's been well for him since then.

it was a near miss, but I don't think it would have led to anything even without Malwarebytes, if it had downloaded a file i wouldn't have opened it without uploading it to VT first to make sure it was clean also my resident AV would have most likely caught it.

I uploaded a picture of the original taunt, which the hacker did respond to

What's your story?","I once opened a worm that I knew was malicious, but was expecting the antivirus I was using a trial version of to stop it from running. But it didn't, as maybe it didn't block scripts, even though the antivirus did have signatures for it. As a result a lot of files such as pictures were overwritten and in those days I didn't have backups. Of course now days I backup my files and never knowingly launch malware, other than on systems I use for testing.

I know the feeling. I did this a couple of times when I was a kid really. First three times were out of ignorance.

Because they can hammer you with traffic to cause denial of service. Or constantly hit you with known exploits until they find one that your equipment is vulnerable to. If you keep your networking equipment and operating system up to date the second is a low risk, but not impossible. And lastly you can be geolocated by your IP address, to some extent. It doesn’t need to be secret, but nobody you aren’t already connecting to really needs your IP address either."

To run those types of apps you would need to install .NET.

As far as I know, .NET itself won't cause any security issues, and it's mostly up to the developers to keep their apps safe and not have any weird code or poorly protected code. Something to keep in mind is that .NET applications are extremely easy to deobfuscate and view the source code using an application called dnSpy."

Change your most common passwords and especially Gmail or other e-mail associate with two-factor authentication.
At this moment exist a ""race"" for passwords from VPNs, streaming channels, etc online, Argentinian and Indian hackers are the most prolific and it's possible to buy an EXpress VPN online for 5€, they crack and sell the passwords.
Basically, they are stealing passwords from the corner pizza and using Openbullet to test that password in every major VPN and streaming service.

P.S. - Be extremely careful with android phones and apk, that game you see online for free, or that version of express VPN with a trial that never end, be careful many of that apk do more than they are supposed to do.

This is an example, you can find people selling access to every major platform in telegram or in discord:

To be safe, your e-mail that is responsible for the two-factor authentication has to have a unique password, don't repeat the password for stemming accounts, VPNs, AVs, etc, anything that can be sold online should have its own password.
Forget the rest, your e-mail and password will be leaked sooner or later, that site that you registered to download drawings for the kids, or that small application, etc, something will be leaked, don't doubt. They put that combo of passwords and e-mail in a application and test in every platform they can obtain money from, if the password doesn't match you will be safe.

Sometimes GMail deletes really old emails if your Google Drive space is full (IIRC), but to be safe, I don't think that's what happened.

The best tips I can give is to make sure everything has a safe and secure type of 2FA, phone authentication / Auth application is probably the best way to stay safe. Try to enable 2FA on your password managers (Better safe than sorry), GMail, and any other applications with crucial data."

How you gonna police every single employee's digital usage even in a small company of 500 employees? It is an impossible task, even with monitoring software. And management rarely implements the things that cyber security personnel recommend. That's even if the company has qualified cyber sec professional on staff.

Some website developers are recognizing the need for strong passwords and making it such that the user must use them to create an account.

But what are you supposed to do in a 1000 person company, with only 2 admins, and they use the word ""password"" as the password for all their admin stuff on every single device in the company ? It is admin negligence, but at the same time those admins can be so overburdened and their management won't listen to them. So it is not so straightforward. You have to remember, unless something is mandated by law, companies will not do it. Companies want the pleasant fiction of a one-button solution that works silently and seamlessly and solves all their security problems. They don't want to hire the small army of security staff needed to properly protect even a small commercial network. Management does not understand security typically and they don't understand why something they have just downloaded is being blocked. Overall, the reality out there, while getting better, is both absurd and dismal. But revenue and profits always comes first."

"Feb 24, 2022",Russia vs Ukraine: How does this affect Russian products like Kaspersky?,"Hello, everyone in the community,

I am thinking here in my corner (Brazil) about this conflict that is occurring between Ukraine x Russia. The information that is being passed on through the American media and even here in my country is that Russia will suffer several economic sanctions and in several other sectors.

— How can this affect Kaspersky products, after all, it is a product of Russian origin.
— The US and other countries are sanctioning Russian billionaires, wouldn't Eugene Kaspersky be on one of those lists?
— How safe is it to continue using Kaspersky at this time? A few days ago I renewed my Kaspersky subscription for another 2 years and 10 devices (I still have 728 days left).

Thank you ","Overall I’ve been pro Kaspersky in the past campaigns to cast doubt on their trustworthiness. I still don’t see any evidence that the product’s protection is compromised by these events, but I think at this point Russia’s actions have given a lot more people reason to think about whether or not they want to be associated with purchasing a product that may result in their money going to Russia. 

Yes Kaspersky’s servers are in Switzerland and they have American and other subsidiaries but I am not convinced that the company is totally impervious to Putin having influence, especially during times of war and especially since cyber warfare is a big part of this conflict too. 

I think it’s understandable to want to change to a different product on moral grounds. It is similar to not wanting to watch some movie because the actor turned out to be a rapist. But at the same time I don’t think it’s necessary to do on a technical basis. If Kaspersky starts doing unscrupulous things, I’m sure it will be noticed very quickly by the cybersecurity world."

I agree. ATM I'm not worried about using their software but if conflict escalates and extends to cyber, Kaspersky might get orders to perform actions they usually wouldn't want to do. And AFAIK you can't say ""No"" if order comes from the top."

I would say that’s true for now but not really something you can guarantee like that. Every AV program permits frequent background updates and those updates can do basically anything on your system. Even if not directly, they can push a malicious set of disinfecting rules or ask System Watcher to upload more things. 

I am not saying they are doing that. I’m just saying this is all possible regardless of what the client side source code says. And this isn’t just antivirus. The same can be said about Windows or MacOS or anything else that gets background updates."

Thank you for your honesty. I'll be honest too. There is an expression - ""If a person repeats 1000 times that he is a pig, he will grunt."" Now ask yourself the question - How many times has Putin heard from the leaders of Europe and America that he is a tyrant and a murderer? How many times did the Western media ""shout"" about this? I periodically visit and read the websites of the Western press, in particular, what they write about Putin. In the two decades that Putin has been in power in Russia, I have read almost nothing good about him in the Western press, however, how little good is written about Russia there either. Now everyone is in shock, but no one asked himself the question - Why did Putin do this? I can guess why he did it. And I can say for sure that this is not because he is ""just a bloodthirsty tyrant."" I will not write here in detail, after all, this is politics, and this forum is not a political platform."

I think that only a few people will actually boycott products, most people have no interest in them and do not even know where a particular product comes from.

"Feb 9, 2022",Mark-of-the-Web from a red team’s perspective,"


Mark-of-the-Web from a red team’s perspective​Stan Hegt | March 30, 2020
Zone Identifier Alternate Data Stream information, commonly referred to as Mark-of-the-Web (abbreviated MOTW), can be a significant hurdle for red teamers and penetration testers, especially when attempting to gain an initial foothold.

Your payload in the format of an executable, MS Office file or CHM file is likely to receive extra scrutiny from the Windows OS and security products when that file is marked as downloaded from the internet. In this blog post we will explain how this mechanism works and we will explore offensive techniques that can help evade or get rid of MOTW.

Note that the techniques described in this blog post are not new. We have witnessed all of them being abused in the wild. Hence, this blog post serves to raise awareness on these techniques for both red teamers (for more realistic adversary simulations) and blue teamers (for better countermeasures and understanding of attacker techniques).

Introduction to MOTW​Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) is a security feature originally introduced by Internet Explorer to force saved webpages to run in the security zone of the location the page was saved from. Back in the days, this was achieved by adding an HTML comment in the form of <!-–saved from url=> at the beginning of a saved web page.

This mechanism was later extended to other file types than HTML. This was achieved by creating an alternate data stream (ADS) for downloaded files. ADS is an NTFS file system feature that was added as early as Windows 3.1. This feature allows for more than one data stream to be associated with a filename, using the format “filename:streamname”.

When downloading a file, Internet Explorer creates an ADS named Zone.Identifier and adds a ZoneId to this stream in order to indicate from which zone the file originates. Although it is not an official name, many people still refer to this functionality as Mark-of-the-Web.

Listing and viewing alternate data streams is trivial using PowerShell: both the Get-Item and Get-Content cmdlets take a “Stream” parameter, as can be seen in the following screenshot.




The following ZoneId values may be used in a Zone.Identifier ADS:

0. Local computer
1. Local intranet
2. Trusted sites
3. Internet
4. Restricted sites
Nowadays all major software on the Windows platform that deals with attachments or downloaded files generates a Zone.Identifier ADS, including Internet Explorer, Edge, Outlook, Chrome, FireFox, etc. How do these programs write this ADS? Either by creating the ADS directly or via the system’s implementation of the IAttachmentExecute interface. The behavior of the latter can be controlled via the SaveZoneInformation property in the Attachment Manager.

Note that Windows 10’s implementation of the IAttachmentExecute interface will also add URL information to the Zone.Identifier ADS:




For red teamers, it’s probably good to realize that MOTW will also get set when using the HTML smuggling technique (note the “blob” keyword in the screenshot above, which is an indicator of potential HTML smuggling).

The role of MOTW in security measures​The information from the Zone Identifier Alternate Data Stream is used by Windows, MS Office and various other programs to trigger security features on downloaded files. The following are the most notable ones from a red teamer’s perspective (but there are more – this list is far from complete).

Windows Defender SmartScreen

This feature works by checking downloaded executable files (based on Zone Identifier ADS) against a whitelist of files that are well known and downloaded by many Windows users. If the file is not on that list, Windows Defender SmartScreen shows the following warning:




MS Office protected view

The Protected View sandbox attempts to protect MS Office users against potential risks in files originating from the internet or other dangerous zones. By default, most MS Office file types flagged with MOTW will be opened in this sandbox. Many users know this feature as MS Office’s famous yellow bar with the “Enable Editing” button.




MWR (now F-Secure labs) has published a great technical write-up on this sandbox some years ago. Note that some MS Office file types cannot be loaded in the Protected View sandbox. SYLK is a famous example of this.

MS Office block macros downloaded from the internet

This feature was introduced in Office 2016 and later back-ported to Office 2013. If this setting is enabled, macros in MS Office files flagged with MOTW are disabled and a message is displayed to the user.




This warning message cannot be ignored by the end user, which makes it a very effective measure against mass-scale macro-based malware.

Visual Studio project files

Opening untrusted Visual Studio project files can be dangerous (see my presentation at Nullcon Goa 2020 for the reasons why). By default, Visual Studio will display a warning message for any project file which has the MOTW attribute set.




Application Guard for Office

This newly announced feature runs potentially malicious macros embedded in MS Office files in a small virtual machine (based on Application Guard technology) in order to protect the OS.




From the limited documentation available, the decision to run a document in a VM is based on MOTW. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to this technology yet, so I cannot confirm this statement through testing.

","I posted this nice article here because the knowledge about MOTW is commonly non-existent.
The author mentioned some important examples of using MOTW by Windows and Microsoft products. But there are more examples like using MOTW by Adobe Reader, Microsoft Defender (BAFS), and Avast/AVG Antivirus (CyberCapture).
In February 2022 Microsoft decided to block macros by default in MS Office for documents originating from the Internet and MOTW is required for that. Anyway, this is true only for the new installations. "

Opening untrusted Visual Studio project files can be dangerous (see my presentation at Nullcon Goa 2020 for the reasons why). By default, Visual Studio will display a warning message for any project file which has the MOTW attribute set.




Application Guard for Office

This newly announced feature runs potentially malicious macros embedded in MS Office files in a small virtual machine (based on Application Guard technology) in order to protect the OS.




From the limited documentation available, the decision to run a document in a VM is based on MOTW. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to this technology yet, so I cannot confirm this statement through testing.

Besides unzipping rar archives, I noticed another case where MOTW is lost: you download a file in a non-Windows OS.

The person stating this has clearly never done software development. But sure, just read through 200 000 lines of code before you are allowed to use logging. And of course you also have to have the IT security knowledge to do that.
Imagine you require from ever person before using any device, be it TV, fridge, bicycle, laptop, car, ... that they also know how it was built, how it looks from the inside and whether it is safe to use. That's about the same amount of work and time. We would still be living in trees.

From the title I expected a warning about not using StackOverflow or tutorial code just as is, because those are often example codes without any safety checks. But calling library usage ""cut-and-pasted programming"" (sic) seems pretty odd."
"Dec 31, 2021",Q&A - How cut-and-pasted programming is putting the internet and society at risk,How cut-and-pasted programming is putting the internet and society at risk | John Naughton,"

You looking at it the wrong way, you not using the bicycle you building it, and if you just copy others without understanding what you doing, you get a mediocre product. If you copy pasting over 200k lines of code, you doing something wrong.

I agree with the article, we cursed with lazy and mediocre developers that copy paste others code, and there's lots of drawbacks including performance costs (not only security). Lots of outdated code online that don't take into account newer standards (not to mention you could be copying the wrong solution for your problem).

I rather take months to write my code from scratch, with all the ups of downs of debugging, rather than copying someone elses dirty code (unfortunally this is not possible for everyone, due to lack of knownledge and time constrains).

As for the context of the article itself, Java Libraries having exploits is not news to anyone, and that particular game Minecraft, is dirty code from top to bottom."
"Dec 31, 2021",Q&A - How cut-and-pasted programming is putting the internet and society at risk,How cut-and-pasted programming is putting the internet and society at risk | John Naughton,"If I have to build a bicycle before I can use it, that is even worse.

Using a library is not the same as copy and pasting.

The people who think they have the knowledge to build everything from scratch are the same that program their own encryption algorithms and build in errors because they are simply no cryptographic experts. I see this over and over happen in ransomware. The ones we cannot crack are usually those that use crypto APIs properly instead of attempting crypto themselves. (Granted, there are also people who use the crypto APIs the wrong way, but they would not do better if they wrote the API code themselves)

You cannot be an expert in everything and if you attempt to do that, you write the same dirty code that you are trying to avoid."

I am not sure why and can only guess.

As a malware author you might prefer to create a 32 bit file to cover a wider range of susceptible systems that includes all the outdated ones (32 bit also works on 64 bit machines, so this is the better option in regards to mass targetting malware). Also 32 bit malware has been around far longer in general. So for many malware families the AV systems only see 32 bit versions.

For performance reasons almost all signature based detections are tied to file types. 32 bit PE files are handled differently than 64 bit (they need slightly different parsing). So the signatures that were created for 32 bit malware only work on 32 bit files, thus can only have false positives on 32 bit files."

If your email provider is correctly identifying them as spam, and they are going to your junk mail folder and not your inbox, that's a good thing, as they are kept separate from emails you want to receive. The only thing I would suggest is that if any spam email ever goes to your inbox, rather than your spam folder, then instead of just deleting it, you should have the option to mark it as spam. This will train the spam filter to become better at identifying spam emails, which should result in less spam emails going to your inbox.

Thank you very much.","In regard to Gmail, there is nothing to be paranoid about, unless you carry sensitive information in that particular email. I made my Gmail account when Gmail was just an email account and not connected to any of the other Google services many a year ago, hell even before android required it to function. Primarily used it for potential spam accounts/logins, account forms I wasn't sure about or accounts I knew I would delete at some point.

Now 2021, well over 15 years later, that email has been flagged in consumer spam, ""research"" and copy-pasted by bots in large spam lists so many times no one count any more. Since Gmail has one of the best, well better, spam filters/algorithms out there as far as free email accounts go. And with most of those bot networks have been shutdown by now, I only get somewhere in between 3-6 emails a week in the spam-folder.

Only look into that folder whenever I know I am expecting a particular email, otherwise I let it clear itself out automatically every 30 days.

Have to note, that I use this same account for my Android smartphone as well. Just make sure you have [A] a strong password,  2FA enabled and [C] Important contacts (and recovery codes) backed up properly, and you're Gucci. Though, when in doubt, change password and reset 2FA in absolute worst-case scenario."

First of all, as you say, there are phishing sites that copy identically the known sites (ISP, bank etc).
There are also other attacks like exploits, drive-by downloads or spam with attachments.

Exploit : A site that exploits security holes in targeted software (browser, Java, Flash, etc.) in order to install malicious software (Ransomware, Worm, Trojan, Botnet, etc.) without your consent.

To protect yourself: Update all your software and a strong antivirus.

Drive-by download : Site that will force you to install malware by exploiting ALL the flaws of the machine ! It is the most violent.

To protect yourself : Same as the exploit.

Spam : You receive an email with an attachment you don't know... Curious, you open it... but the damage is done!

 The link itself is not dangerous. Until you click on it  However, even if you click on such a link, then in this case you may be lucky - your antivirus will respond to the download of a malicious file, or if you get to a phishing site, you will notice that the site fake (spelling errors, incorrect design, wrong site address, unencrypted connection, broken interactive elements, and much more). 
Surprisingly, even if your antivirus does not know the malware, you may still be lucky, and there was such a case when a user clicked on a link in an email, after which his default browser, Google Chrome, was launched. But the malicious file was not downloaded, since the attack was aimed only at users of the Mozilla Firefox browser, in which the attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability  And users of Google Chrome and browsers on Chromium were safe and could click the link at least 100 times  They were simply presented with a blank website page, while Mozilla Firefox users were running a script that exploited a zero-day vulnerability, which downloaded and launched the Trojan.
But why would you risk so much? It is better not to click on links in letters from unknown senders."

With all due respect, and because I'm a proponent - even a cheerleader  - of uBlock Origin, a decent measure of additional security can be achieved by enabling Enhanced Easy mode which can block malicious code on compromised websites, with very little interaction required by the user in most cases. Only on rare occasion will a user need to allow a harmless iframe for a website to function properly. This effectively is a nice trade-off of considerable security gain with only minimal user interaction. This Blocking mode can be a nice option for less advanced users."

Totally forgot about that mode... Probably I sticked with AdGuard for too long. 
Anyway, I agree with you but I just see uBlock Origin as an adblocker that is hard to understand for the average user. The UI can be irritating and whitelisting specific domains can be hard to understand to. I personally would only install uBlock Origin in default settings on my parent's PC for example, as I know that it could cause a lot of trouble on the enhanced mode when I am not around."

VT is ok. You may also depend on Smartscreen in Edge. And you may use Windows Defender Browser Protection, BD Trafficlight, Malwarebytes Browser Guard or Netcraft extensions in any other browser. These are all reliable with decent detection rates."

It's very good. One of the best. They say they block malicious scripts/third-party sources, but I have never managed to reproduce it or see it in action. Of the ones I tested, only McAfee Web Advisor can block third-party connections that I can assure. Maybe MB Guard also can since it has optional adblocking functionality and also when I checked the log they seem to scan third-party connections too, but I haven't personally seen it blocking."

Also, for those who choose to visit unknown sites, what browser security settings do you put in place to avoid infection?","I've been thinking about this alot recently. And in conclusion (lol), I had to ask myself when was the last time I ran into a malware website? Honestly maybe somewhere in the 2000s. I have to make a serious effort to find a malware site that hasn't already been filtered out by Google, stopped out by nextDNS, blocked by Firefox or uBlock Origin. You see there are many layers and I think if you have layers of security. I think the best way to vet is to use brain.exe. Is the site unfamiliar? Navigate away, don't even click. Stick to familiar reputable sites, don't click on Spam. Don't seek out illicit sites.

I do not like WOT, Traffic Light or Malwarebytes. They give you little security in exchange for sending a list of all the websites you are visiting. That's not a good deal at all."

Also, for those who choose to visit unknown sites, what browser security settings do you put in place to avoid infection?","I agree with most posted. A layered approach is best.

Use a DNS service with rogue URL protection like Quad9 or NextDNS to off load the heavy work at data/server centers of the DNS back bone.

Some routers offer URL filtering also. When your router has it, you might as well use it.

Use the build in bad URL protection of your browser (Smartscreen or Safe browsing).

Most AV's have got URL filtering also. In case your AV does not have it, you could add an url/malware protection extension from one of the leading AV's.

URL filtering is a numbers game, so the obvious choices would be Microsoft Defender Browser Protection, Avast/Norton (I guess they will be sharing data) and Bitdefender Traffic Light.

My old friend Peter2150 (rip) always said that MalwareBytes had the best URL protection (in his tests with malware), so this would qualify MalwareBytes browser guard also as an extension option.

As with most free things in life, most of the above mentioned solutions use your data to improve their services."

I am not sure if you look at the problem from the right side. If someone will perform Bad USB attack on your computer, then the USB device will be intentionally prepared for it. Here is an example of such an attack:

To avoid sketchy sites I'd recommend setting up NextDNS as his DNS provider which has multiple web-protection shields for different scenarios. It can for example recognize when he accidentally tries to access Gooogle.com instead of Google.com (Typosquatting protection)

There are different ways of setting up a new DNS provider. You can either do it network-wide (router) or just on a single device. It may sound complicated at first but NextDNS has an easy step by step setup guide.

If your old man (dad?) is a cautious and reasonable person when using the computer, then you can follow the @SecureCongo advice. Instruct him about the danger of opening attachments and following URLs in emails, some basics about phishing, etc. Warn him about the danger of ignoring SmartScreen.

If you can configure the software to auto-update on SUA and your dad does not need to install new applications by himself, then there is a simple way to make him safe by using Windows hardening + Microsoft Defender. Otherwise, after hardening the occasional help from the Home Administrator will be required.
Windows, Edge, Chrome, Microsoft Store Apps, and some other applications can auto-update when the user works on a Standard User Account (SUA). Microsoft applications can be updated via Windows Updates (requires the right setup of Windows Updates). Generally, all software that uses scheduled tasks configured to use high privileges can auto-update when the user works on SUA.

If it is not possible and your dad is going to use the computer without any help, then the simplest way is to buy Kaspersky Internet Security and configure it to @harlan4096 setup. This will work well for popular software. Otherwise, some software updates and some new versions of applications will be blocked for a few days. A similar setup (but slightly less safe) can be applied by using Norton 360 or Avast (set to Hardened Mode).

There are many other possibilities depending on how strong are your dad's safe habits, how frequently he installs new applications, how risky can be his activities, etc."

Hello. Yes, this could be malware. The file extension does not say anything about the actual file type. It only tells the operating system which programs are used per default to open the file, e.g., if you double-click on it. A malware can still execute such files by directly calling the correct program. The mere fact that you say it contains glibberish tells me that it is NOT a text file.

No, I don't think OP launched potential code in the file by opening it in a text editor (and never said that).
But it is on their system and arrived there somehow. If it is malicious (which we don't know yet), it is a sign that the system is infected, was infected or that there was an infection attempt. Infection chains often involve several files. So if there was an infection or an attemped one, it is probably not the only file involved.

"Jul 20, 2022",Malware Analysis - High‑impact UEFI vulnerabilities discovered in Lenovo consumer laptops,"


ESET researchers have discovered and analyzed three vulnerabilities affecting various Lenovo consumer laptop models. The first two of these vulnerabilities – CVE-2021-3971, CVE-2021-3972 – affect UEFI firmware drivers originally meant to be used only during the manufacturing process of Lenovo consumer notebooks. Unfortunately, they were mistakenly included also in the production BIOS images without being properly deactivated. These affected firmware drivers can be activated by attacker to directly disable SPI flash protections (BIOS Control Register bits and Protected Range registers) or the UEFI Secure Boot feature from a privileged user-mode process during OS runtime. It means that exploitation of these vulnerabilities would allow attackers to deploy and successfully execute SPI flash or ESP implants, like LoJax or our latest UEFI malware discovery ESPecter, on the affected devices.

To understand how we were able to find these vulnerabilities, consider the firmware drivers affected by CVE‑2021-3971. These drivers immediately caught our attention by their very unfortunate (but surprisingly honest) names: SecureBackDoor and SecureBackDoorPeim. After some initial analysis, we discovered other Lenovo drivers sharing a few common characteristics with the SecureBackDoor* drivers: ChgBootDxeHook and ChgBootSmm. As it turned out, their functionality was even more interesting and could be abused to disable UEFI Secure Boot (CVE-2021-3972).

In addition, while investigating above mentioned vulnerable drivers, we discovered the third vulnerability: SMM memory corruption inside the SW SMI handler function (CVE-2021-3970). This vulnerability allows arbitrary read/write from/into SMRAM, which can lead to the execution of malicious code with SMM privileges and potentially lead to the deployment of an SPI flash implant.

We reported all discovered vulnerabilities to Lenovo on October 11th, 2021. Altogether, the list of affected devices contains more than one hundred different consumer laptop models with millions of users worldwide, from affordable models like Ideapad-3 to more advanced ones like Legion 5 Pro-16ACH6 H or Yoga Slim 9-14ITL05. The full list of affected models with active development support is published in the Lenovo Advisory.

In addition to the models listed in the advisory, several other devices we reported to Lenovo are also affected, but won’t be fixed due to...........................

....

RANSOMWARE ATTACKS LEVERAGING AI/ML​The security community might begin seeing ransomware attacks that incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Learning (ML) in the attack flow. This would involve ransomware operations using AI/ML to streamline their reconnaissance of the target and as part of their infection chains to optimize payloads to the targeted network.

“Some researchers have done lab tests and created in-house AI malware. It’s certainly a possible thing, but how we’re going to actually see it, how often we see it, is really what concerns me the most,” reported VentureBeat.

“I really do see AI and machine learning being used for grabbing data from leaks, or from social media or from anywhere else to create profiles of particular users or your ideal victim profile. You can use all that information to create far more efficient spear-phishing against businesses or anybody else you want.”

Additionally, threat actors can use AI/ML to discover paths for spreading malware by scouring the web for known exploit channels. They can then apply that knowledge with the help of AI/ML tools once they’ve established a foothold on a target’s network to propagate their malware.

RANSOMWARE ATTACKS: COMPLEX AND PERVASIVE​It’s important to note that the security community hasn’t necessarily confirmed that AI/ML capabilities have been used in ransomware attacks just yet, but that doesn’t mean ransomware infections today aren’t already more sophisticated than in recent years in a way that challenges traditional security approaches. The most significant indicator of this is that many malware gangs don’t distribute ransomware by way of mass spam email campaigns or unfocused watering-hole and drive-by attacks anymore.

Instead, they are increasingly engaged in more complex, low-and-slow attacks designed to compromise as much of the targeted network as possible to exact the highest ransom demand from the victims in what’s known as RansomOps attacks.

RansomOps are different from commodity ransomware attacks of the past, where malicious actors use “spray and pray” tactics to pressure single victims into paying small ransom demands. By contrast, RansomOps are highly targeted, complex attacks more akin to an APT operation.

RansomOps also typically involve multiple threat actors from the larger Ransomware Economy. This includes threat actors like Initial Access Brokers (IABs) who penetrate the network, Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers who provide the attack infrastructure and malicious code, the RaaS associates who carry out the attack, and more.

RansomOps use an array of advanced techniques to complicate detection and response. In March 2021, for example, Threatpost reported on a new Ryuk ransomware variant that came with the ability to self-propagate as a worm. Ryuk’s operators accomplished this by scanning for network shares and copying a version of their ransomware executable wherever they found those assets using the Server Message Block (SMB) Windows function.

Some RansomOps also use evasion tactics to fly under the radar of traditional security solutions. For example, a Conti ransomware variant back in February 2021 used “API-by-hash” to apply two layers of encryption over its functions, thus making the work of a reverse engineer more difficult. It was nearly a year later when researchers wrote about White Rabbit’s use of a specific command-line password to conceal its internal configuration. The list goes on.

Phishing attacks are one of the most common causes of security breaches according to Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report. Most phishing attacks arrive via emails containing malicious attachments. A seemingly innocent Microsoft Word file, for example, can be the initial infection stage of a dangerous attack where a threat actor uses a document to deliver malware.​
Handling Malicious Microsoft Office Files During Incident Response​When handling a security breach, the incident response team will collect suspicious files and evidence from the compromised endpoint in order to investigate the incident. One of the challenges IR teams face is finding all of the malicious files that were used in the attack and classifying them to their relevant malware family.

Binary files are usually the main suspect. We know that malicious code was executed, so we search for suspicious binary files containing this code (looking for recently installed programs, for example). Non-binary files like Microsoft Office documents should also be carefully examined because they can be the first stage of an attack that caused the malware execution to begin with.

Office documents are widely used by threat actors to deliver malware. Usually, the file is attached to an email that is crafted to look like a legitimate communication. Threat actors use social engineering techniques to persuade the victim into opening the malicious attachment.

In this article, we will explain the different types of Microsoft Office file formats and how attackers abuse these documents to deliver malware. You will also be presented with tools and techniques that can help you better identify and classify malicious Microsoft Office files.​

Most phishing attacks arrive via emails containing malicious attachments. A seemingly innocent Microsoft Word file, for example, can be the initial infection stage of a dangerous attack where a threat actor uses a document to deliver malware.​
Handling Malicious Microsoft Office Files During Incident Response​When handling a security breach, the incident response team will collect suspicious files and evidence from the compromised endpoint in order to investigate the incident. One of the challenges IR teams face is finding all of the malicious files that were used in the attack and classifying them to their relevant malware family.

Binary files are usually the main suspect. We know that malicious code was executed, so we search for suspicious binary files containing this code (looking for recently installed programs, for example). Non-binary files like Microsoft Office documents should also be carefully examined because they can be the first stage of an attack that caused the malware execution to begin with.

Office documents are widely used by threat actors to deliver malware. Usually, the file is attached to an email that is crafted to look like a legitimate communication. Threat actors use social engineering techniques to persuade the victim into opening the malicious attachment.

In this article, we will explain the different types of Microsoft Office file formats and how attackers abuse these documents to deliver malware. You will also be presented with tools and techniques that can help you better identify and classify malicious Microsoft Office files.​

These are good starting points to search the key. Now you need to verify any assumptions you made.

> if I got it right the genenrates it self by connecting to botnet serve
Does it get the key from the server or 
does it generate the key and afterwards contact the server to send the key to the server?
Do you know why keys might be sent to a server?

> the key should be inside one of the files the ransomware created
It is a valid assumption because some ransomware does save the key in generated files. So this can be one location to look for.
But I personally would start at the key generation algorithm because it comes first and has a high probability that the criminals did something wrong there. Only if this one does not help me (because it is made in a way that we cannot retrieve the key), I would go further down the chain and look at how the key is saved or transmitted after generation.

> Or the ransomware generates the key inside the registry
Also a good location to look for. Some ransomware saves keys in the registry. You might have luck to retrieve the key from the registry of an infected system if the key is not encrypted.
It does not generate keys there, though. The registry is only a place to put settings and data into it.
Since this part comes after key generation, I would put that aside for now. Concentrate on key generation first."

This is the constructor of a Python class named EncryptHD. Do you know how classes generally work?
The constructor builds one object of this class.

To be specific:

When the main code does this:
encryption_mgr = EncryptHD(key)
it will execute the __init__ function, passing the already generated key to it.
The key is saved in the object to be used for later calls on its functions like encrypt_hd and get_aes_encryption and so on.
parent_dir = 'C:\\Users' is a default value that will be used if no other value is present. This is the case here, so for any operations on parent_dir in the EncryptHD functions, it will do them on 'C:\\Users'. If you wanted to change this in the code, it would look like EncryptHD(key, 'C:\\MyNewPathToEncrypt')

Example:


Python:


# this encrypts C:\\Users and all subdirectories using key1
encryption_mgr1 = EncryptHD(key1)
encryption_mgr1.encrypt_hd()
# this encrypts 'C:\\MyNewPathToEncrypt' and all subdirectories using a different key now, namely key2
encryption_mgr2 = EncryptHD(key2, 'C:\\MyNewPathToEncrypt')
encryption_mgr2.encrypt_hd()
# this code now decrypts C:\\Users and all subdirectories using key1
encryption_mgr1.decrypt_hd()
# this code now decrypts 'C:\\MyNewPathToEncrypt' and all subdirectories using key2
encryption_mgr1.decrypt_hd()


You can imagine the constructor as something where you set your settings for all the operations later on that are done with that object (encryption_mgr1 is an object here and encryption_mgr2 is another object here).

Does this answer your question?"

StellarParticle is a campaign tracked by CrowdStrike as related to the SUNSPOT implant from the SolarWinds intrusion in December 2020 and associated with COZY BEAR (aka APT29, “The Dukes”).
The StellarParticle campaign has continued against multiple organizations, with COZY BEAR using novel tools and techniques to complete their objectives, as identified by CrowdStrike incident responders and the CrowdStrike Intelligence team.
Browser cookie theft and Microsoft Service Principal manipulation are two of the novel techniques and tools leveraged in the StellarParticle campaign and are discussed in this blog.
Two sophisticated malware families were placed on victim systems in mid-2019: a Linux variant of GoldMax and a new implant dubbed TrailBlazer.

"May 23, 2022",Malware Analysis - BPFDoor,"Quote: "" BPFDoor is interesting. It allows a threat actor to backdoor a system for remote code execution, without opening any new network ports or firewall rules. For example, if a webapp exists on port 443, it can listen and react on the existing port 443, and the implant can be reached over the webapp port (even with the webapp running). This is because it uses a BPF packet filter.

Operators have access to a tool which allows communication to the implants, using a password, which allows features such as remotely executing commands. This works over internal and internet networks. Because BPFDoor doesn’t open any inbound network ports, doesn’t use an outbound C2, and it renames its own process in Linux (so ps aux, for example, will show a friendly name) it is highly evasive. I swept the internet for BPFDoor throughout 2021, and discovered it is installed at organisations in across the globe— in particular the US, South Korea, Hong Kong, Turkey, India, Viet Nam and Myanmar, and is highly evasive. These organisations include government systems, postal and logistic systems, education systems and more. Inside those organisations I believe it is likely present on thousands of systems. The implant appears to be for surveillance purposes.

Per PwC: "" We also identified that the threat actor sends commands to BPFDoor victims via Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) hosted at a well-known provider, and that these VPSs, in turn, are administered via compromised routers based in Taiwan, which the threat actor uses as VPN tunnels. Most Red Menshen activity that we observed took place between Monday to Friday (with none observed on the weekends), with most communication taking place between 01:00 and 10:00 UTC. This pattern suggests a consistent 8 to 9-hour activity window for the threat actor, with realistic probability of it aligning to local working hours. ""

The implant has been in use for many years — over 5 — and has flown under the radar. ""

"" PwC plan to present their findings in June ""

","





The BPFDoor source is small, focused and well written. While the sample we reviewed was Linux specific, with some small changes it could easily be ported to other platforms (a Solaris binary reportedly exists). BPF is widely available across operating systems and the core shell functions would likely work across platforms with little modification. 

Statically linked it would grow to about 1MB, but the dynamically linked version would likely work on most modern Linux distributions. Cross compiling for various CPUs is also possible so this implant would likely work on embedded Linux devices as well. The binary itself just needs to be downloaded onto the victim and run. It doesn't matter how or where it gets to the host as it takes care of moving itself to a suitable area once run to remain resident. However, the binary does need root permissions to run.

Click to expand...





After the binary starts, it deletes itself making recovery harder. However, recovering a deleted process binary on Linux is trivial once it is running (see our article on how to do it). But the main thing deletion does is allow the binary to avoid detection by malware scanners that rely on file scanning. The binary is simply not on the disk to be scanned and if the main binary is hidden/encrypted on the device for persistence it would be very hard to find.

Click to expand...





Once the implant has done its anti-forensics and evasion housekeeping, it goes into the packet capture loop. The packet capture function loads a BPF filter (hence the name). BPF is a highly efficient way to filter packets coming into a system which massively reduces CPU load by preventing all packets from needing to be analyzed by the receiver. It effectively operates as a very efficient pre-filter and only passes likely valid packets for review to the implant.

With BPFDoor they have taken a BPF filter and converted it to BPF bytecode. This keeps the implant small and less reliant on system libraries that may need to parse a human readable BPF filter, and allows for filters that the normal expression syntax cannot represent.

We have reverse engineered the bytecode below to show you what it is doing. It does basically two things:

Grabs either an ICMP (ping), UDP or TCP packet.
Sees if it has magic data value. If not then reject.


Click to expand...





The relevance of the BPF filter and packet capture is that it is sniffing traffic at a lower level than the local firewall. This means that even if you run a firewall the implant will see, and act upon, any magic packet sent to the system. The firewall running on the local host will not block the implant from having this visibility. This is an important point to understand.

Further, if you have a network perimeter firewall, but it allows traffic to a host on ICMP, UDP or TCP to any port, then the implant can see it. Any inbound traffic to the sever can activate the magic packet check and initiate a backdoor. For instance, if you run a webserver and lock it down so only port TCP 443 can be accessed, the attacker can send a magic packet to TCP port 443 and activate a backdoor. Same for any UDP packet or even a simple ICMP ping.

1. My lab is consists of Kali as a host OS, Remnux VM (which is a gateway) and two windows VMs: win7 and win10. When you do analysis of some sample, where do you often do it? Static analyze is done in Remnux (or in general on other env) and behavior in windows? Or maybe everything could be done in Remnux (with e.g. Cuckoo sandbox)? I'm asking, because I do not understand why should I put all tools in every VM and what environment should I use to run malware sample. For me it moght be enough to have only one VM (Remnux) and analyze everything there, but I'm not sure what with windows samples - can they be run on linux too to do some dynamic analysis?

2. What is your general apporach to analyze of the malware? Could you give some tips what is worth to do first and what next? For example, I get some malware sample which I totally do not know what it is doing. I would start with some Cuckoo analyze, then some static analyze and then run it on some VM. Is it a good approach or how should I choose what to do first?

3. I found some malware samples places, but is there any recommendation where I could take samples by difficult level? To start with some easy examples and then try more difficult, to learn new things.

Using one VM for everything, static and dynamic analysis, is just fine and probably the most convenient option in your case. For dynamic analysis of Windows malware, you need Windows. So I recommend you use a Windows VM for everything, if your focus is on Windows malware. Malware analysts often separate the static analysis stuff because they work on machines that need access to internal systems on their company's network. But as a hobby analyst, you don't have this issue.

2. I made an entire video about that (summary starts at 30:00). But tl;dr is: Extract strings, use Detect it Easy or file type identifiers, and skim through the file in a hex editor first. Simultaneously submit it to an automatic analysis system just to get a superficial overview of the behaviour. Then you decide based on your findings what tools are appropriate to go forward. E.g. if it is a SFX, you extract it first. If it is .NET you check in DnSpy. If it is UPX packed, you unpack it first, ...
So you always go from the superficial and meta data information to the details like actual code. Not the other way around, otherwise you end up disassembling code of, e.g., the Python runtime environment because you did not realize it is a PyInstaller file that you got. Reading the code and debugging is the last thing to do.

Thank you very much! This is great description how to start, I will try to do it. Regarding VMs, I will stay with REMnux as a gateway as a network monitoring tool and will install all needed tools on Windows VM. Do you have also some tools to recommend (apart from general like PeStudio, Process Hacker , Wireshark etc.)? Maybe something less known but also good and useful. 

What do you mean that ""analysts often separate static analysis stuff""? I thought static analyze is less vurnelability as dynamic and could be done without specific environment. It just general overview of the malware without running it, so it sounds (for me) as a safer method."

Yes, it is safer, hence you can perform it on a system that has access to an internal company network.
I was just saying this because for you it does not make sense to use several VMs to separate static from dynamic analysis, whereas it can make sense for someone working at a company."

One more thing which came to my mind when I watched your video. As I see, you have normal internet connection from your VM where you're inspecting malware. Is it a common thing or it depends on the type of malware which is under investigation? Personally, I closed internet connection from my windows VM, it can only communicates with REMnux machine to look at network traffic there. Most of tutorials, videos, articles I read, also told that it should be first thing to do - do not connect your VM with internet.
I downloaded samples to my host and just move them to VM to open there. Maybe I should always do that on VM? I'm just wondering what if I want to get some reports from dynamic sandboxes? Should I open a connection in VM to AnyRun or othet tool online?
I also don't think so, every malware completely forbids using internet during analyze, but if you could elaborate on it and explain when it is really safe to run sample with internet connection turned on and when not.

Also one more question - do you recommend some books of malware analysing? I already read ""Practical Malware Analysis"" Sikorski, Honig, but maybe there are some worth books to read in this topic."

Is there any way to choose easier samples which do not make a lot of damage?

Static analyze is done in Remnux (or in general on other env) and behavior in windows? Or maybe everything could be done in Remnux (with e.g. Cuckoo sandbox)? I'm asking, because I do not understand why should I put all tools in every VM and what environment should I use to run malware sample. For me it moght be enough to have only one VM (Remnux) and analyze everything there, but I'm not sure what with windows samples - can they be run on linux too to do some dynamic analysis?

2. What is your general apporach to analyze of the malware? Could you give some tips what is worth to do first and what next? For example, I get some malware sample which I totally do not know what it is doing. I would start with some Cuckoo analyze, then some static analyze and then run it on some VM. Is it a good approach or how should I choose what to do first?

3. I found some malware samples places, but is there any recommendation where I could take samples by difficult level? To start with some easy examples and then try more difficult, to learn new things.

Probably I will have more questions in the future, but for now I would like to know those basics, which would be very helpful.","1. There is no general answer to that. I depends which compiler was used. I suggest you pair your RE learning efforts with programming small C or C++ programs. Important: Disable compiler optimizations when doing so. Write really small programs and compile them. Check the compiled sample in IDA, try to find that code again and understand how it looks like in the disassembly.
2. Do the easy stuff first. Check the strings, e.g., with strings.exe. Check it in a hex editor. Then look into the code. While analysing the code, make sure to add comments and rename functions along the way. Look up the API calls. Make sure you understand and correctly identify the calling convention that is used.
3. That depends entirely on you. You are the one who sets the goals. When I check malware for blog articles, I usually try to find everything that seems novel to me. Techniques I haven't seen before. Apart from that persistence and spreading techniques are usually important and so is the main functionality or damage it does to a system. Any hints to the threat actor are interesting as well."

Probably I will have more questions in the future, but for now I would like to know those basics, which would be very helpful.","Hi, it's me again. Come back to you with some questions regarding malware analysis. Got some knowledge since last 2 months - read few books, reversed my own programs and also done all Labs from Practical Malware Analysis book, which gave me very good basics (I know book is old, but it still has very good basics to learn). Understand a lot more, but still not enough .
I want to go futher, so I decided to ask about few things again.

1. What is a common or best approach to start analysing when you run real sample? I tried to run many samples and most of them do nothing. They just start and that's all. No CPU usage, procmon shows nothing, same autoruns. I'm wondering why? I have a separated VM (windows do to run samples and linux to monitoring newtork, both with isolated, private network and fake dns) with all needed tools and would like to do some basic dynamic analysis first, but often it is impossible, because I do not get any results. 
For example this sample - MalwareBazaar | Browse malware samples 
It doesn't seem to have anti-analysis stuff and when I ran it, it only started and nothing more - no internal registry usage, no network etc. Wondering why?

2. Anti-analysing techniques - do you have some advices regarding this? Articles or some stuff which could help to remove it from code and work on ""clear"" malware without any anti-analysing things? How do you fight with anti-analysis issues, how do you prepare your sample to run and to work with? I see I have big recognition problem what is a ""good"" code and what is junk and anti-analysing code. How could I fight with it?

3. Static analysing with IDA - what is your approach to analyze code statically? I see that I often fall into rabbit hole, want to analyze everything step by step and in the end I know nothing about analyzed code. I think, I'm doing something wrong but it is difficult to find out what would be better, that's why I'm asking - how to miss unnecessary stuff during analyze and focus only on important parts? What are those important parts? For example, my first tactic is always to check strings, check general info about file, run it on VM and observe behaviour. Then I look on some specific parts in IDA, like registry creation, network connections (or other internet stuff), file creation/modification, etc. But a lot of samples have a very huge codebase, so it is difficult to focus only on one part and often I am lost in it.

4. Samples - are there any ""easier"" or better malware families to analyze for beginner? I know that in general all malware is lottery, but maybe some types are better to start with than others?
Do you advise to filter samples somehow?

5. Could you elaborate (e.g. step-by-step) your own tactics and approaches when you start analysing samples? How do you start? What are you looking for first? When you are ready to go deeper, etc.? It would be great to have general overview, because I may understand more and create my own path then.

Hope you find some time to answer, maybe they are stupid questions, but I would like to understand fundamentals well."

Probably I will have more questions in the future, but for now I would like to know those basics, which would be very helpful.","1. Without analysing this sample: I can see that it is very old and a RAT. Those will generally not show much behaviour because they need a working C&C. Even two weeks can be too old for that. RATs always need that, and downloaders also need some working download locations. However it should be possible to see the network communication attempt, at least. Some samples have long sleeps and only run after some time. I sometimes let samples run over lunch and see what they were up to after my break.
Again, this is a generalized answer, I did not analyse the sample you gave. It is also possible there was an anti-reversing technique, that the sample is corrupt, buggy or needs some environmental factors (libraries, frameworks, other files, ...) that are not installed.
The best approach if it does not run is to do static in-depth analysis and debugging, see where it exits and what conditions were checked before that or what kind of exception is thrown.

2. To get deeper into that, check out this anti-reversing reference. Do not only read it but build your own samples by writing assembly or C code (I personally used FASM), then disassemble/debug them with IDA. Defeating a technique is usually not that hard once you are able to recognize it, because most of the time all you gotta do is change a conditional check or a jump.
I started this way. I didn't work through the whole book, but it still helped a lot to recreate some of them.
There are also ways to harden your VM to defeat some VM detection techniques. Google them.

3. Don't be too hard on yourself. You just started, so naturally you will get lost because you won't recognize what is in front of you. I recommend to set small goals. Concentrate on fully analysing one (smaller) function instead of the whole malware code. I recommend the book Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering. It is an old book but still relevant, because it will open your eyes to how you go about reversing in general. How you determine the calling convention. How you find out what the code does if you have nothing else (no strings etc).
Currently your biggest issue is probably recognizing common functions and algorithms. This only comes with experience. Use comments, variable and function renaming in IDA, to make the code better readable while you work through it
If real samples are too intimidating yet and you get lost too often, program smaller samples yourself. C or C++ are ideal candidates here. Disable compiler optimization, then compile the sample, then disassemble the sample and try to find and understand how each part of that code looks like in the disassembly.
Btw this is something I still do if there are new execution environments that I don't understand yet, e.g., Go binaries look a bit different than C and C++ applications, so you can help yourself to learn how they work by compiling your own program and disassembling it afterwards.
What you can also do is pick a sample that is referenced by a malware analysis article. Then try to find and understand the code pieces that the article mentions.

4. Generally stealers, downloaders and keyloggers tend to be easier. .NET assemblies, PyInstaller malware, Batch2EXE wrapped files also tend to be a bit more beginner friendly.
As a beginner I would keep my hands off of worms, viruses (file infectors) and ransomware. Not because they are hard, but because they are risky.
RATs are interesting, but not ideal to start with because they need a working C&C to see action in dynamic analysis.
Also, as a beginner, I would avoid Go, VB6 and Delphi binaries. C++ can be difficult if it uses a lot of object oriented code, but if not, it is much like C. Code written in assembly and C tends to be a bit more beginner friendly.

5. There is no generic approach to this. It highly depends on the sample. It depends on what you see in there and what your goal of the analysis is. In my daily work I mostly create detection signatures, so static analysis of file and memory dumps to find patterns for the signature is enough in 90% of the cases.
When I hunt and pick samples for blog articles, I spend a lot of time figuring out if the sample is already a known family or something new, so I research a lot and take detections names on VT, Intezer, yara rule matches, sandbox reports and typical strings as a basis for the research.
When I finally have a sample to analyze in-depth, most of the time is usually spent on deobfuscation (if the sample is obfuscated). For my latest sample this task took me two weeks (with breaks, though, it would have been one week or so if I did not have other tasks in between). Reading the code once it is deobfuscated, is not really the issue.
I fear I cannot help you with this question because it is too broad.

Understand. I ran it with x64dbg and indeed, it fell into some Thread sleep loop. But you probably right, if I have fake dns and redirecting it would never reach C&C server.

Yes, I know this article, already read it and have it at hand all the time. I will look on this VM detections, because it probably cause more problems for me, because I cannot find out often where to find anti-VM code in the sample. 
And yes, I create some small C/C++ programs and disassmble them to look for specific structures, behaviours or patterns. It is helpful, but it also is very different than malware code from real samples.

Yes, I'm trying. I also find new sample which is much better to analyze and as I see I can recognize many fields and understand what it is doing and how it works. Also, function graphs in IDA are amazing, because I can choose some interesting path at the beginning and anlyze it part by part. 
I also started this book and trying to apply those methods to my work. What I find out in working with IDA is that I often do not know where e.g. given var or parameter is set and what value is there. It is hard for me. But, I also tried to solve it by running example in debugger and watch all values set in given function. 

This is my common approach when I looking for new samples - before I even download sample, I read articles, malpedia, other reports regarding specific type of malware. If I have all theoretical stuff, I start to analyze sample.

That's good to know. Keyloggers and stealers as I see are commonly recommended for beginners. I also find new sample - Ardamax, keylogger theZoo/malware/Binaries/Keylogger.Ardamax at master · ytisf/theZoo and as I said above, I find it pretty friendly to analyze. It runs, do something, was packed, but I unpacked it with debugger and it seems to be good one for start.

I also tried to run some ransomwares in my isolated env (GrandGrab or WannaCry), but when I looked at the code in IDA it was quite big and difficult. Hope to come back to these samples in the future. I'm also focused only on C/C++ PE samples, so all Delphis or NET one need to wait now.

I thought so. Everything depends on specific example and every approach would be different. 
Regarding obfuscated programs - is there any common techniques/programs or some good books to learn how to deobfuscate strings? As I know it is often a simple XOR or base64 used for this, but maybe there are more spohisticated algorithms which are more difficult to solve? 99% of samples I see have obfuscation so it owuld be nice to know how to fight with it.

Regarding videos, I watch OALabs and cybercdh mostly. Sometimes John Hammond channel, but it is not striclty related to malware analysis."

String deobfuscation tends to be one of the easier tasks, since it is often just one ore more functions called to decode the strings. So in many cases you can find that function and decode the string by checking its output. That even works if you have no idea what algorithm is used for decoding. A step up to that is reversing this algorithm and programming your own string decoder, e.g., in IDA Python for automatic decoding of all the strings.
XOR and base64 are common. I also use CyberChef to test hypothesis, because sometimes I see a string and think, it looks like XOR. But often you have custom algorithms.

Control flow obfuscation is harder to deal with. If you are lucky, someone has already created a tool. But otherwise it is a pita.

I think you are already doing very well in regards to your malware analysis learning. You will reach learning plateaus where you think you learn nothing, but that is normal for any kind of learning. Keep going if that happens. At some point you will look back and realize how much you have actually learnt. Reversing needs quite some frustration resistance at times. Also, you will never stop learning, the field is so vast. I do this professionally since 2015 and still feel like a noob sometimes."

Got it. Will take a deeper look on these obfuscation techniques, thanks.

One more thing regarding RAT/Botnets analyze or other type of malware using C&C. I understand it is hard to analyze old samples, because probably domains for C&C servers do not exist anymore, but how do you simulate or prepare your environment to test/analyze this kind of samples? Connection with external server is ""main"" logic there, but probably you don't want to send direct requests to attackers domain, so what is an approach? Do you change hosts somehow to fake this connection and let malware thinks it connects to real domain?
As of now my laboratory looks like:
- HyperV with configured network
- Ubuntu VM with external and private network - external to downaload samples, private to have isolated connection between this machine and Windows machine. I use Burp and InetSim.
- Windows 10 VM (FLARE VM package) with only private network configured (totally cut off from internet), so all network requests from malware are redirected on ports to InetSim and Burp.

As I understand this configuration do not give me 100% chances to run RAT or Botnets dynamically and look what they are doing? In some point, all those malwares will sleep or wait for connection to C&C. So what should I change here to prepare environment for this type of malware?"

You don't need 100% chance that they show behavior. If they don't show behavior, you continue with other methods of analysis.
In most cases you will see at least persistence and injection/unpacking behavior, though."
"Apr 15, 2022",Q&A - Trying to analyze a game exe file claimed to be false positive,"Hi, first I would like to mention I know near to nothing about malware analysis. I just wanted to play a discontinued old game on a private server but keep my PC secure at the same time.

I first checked files with Bitdefender, it shows a clear result. Then I wanted to check at least the exe file with VirusTotal and it showed 3 malicious flags. I also checked the file with Intezer Analyze, it also flagged it as malicious. I asked to discord server of the game, they claimed it is a false positive. I tried to find a sandbox program but saw you guys don't recommend it. I also learned I should check the first time in VT. It seems old but doesn't know what to do with that info. Today, the number of flags are increased to 5 but still no companies like Kaspersky or BitDefender.

","I don’t see anything too suspicious there. Writing to a software hive seems fine, and the second key is an ACPI check for the model of your computer (games sometimes do that). 

The fact that it’s an old game and has an expired certificate is likely making all the analysis tools treat it as unsigned and hence tipping towards more suspicious. Most of the VT engines marking it as suspicious are either pure AI engines or a sandbox analyzer. At least that means that zero malware analysts have marked your sample suspicious, which is a good sign."

"Apr 15, 2022",Q&A - Trying to analyze a game exe file claimed to be false positive,"Hi, first I would like to mention I know near to nothing about malware analysis. I just wanted to play a discontinued old game on a private server but keep my PC secure at the same time.

I first checked files with Bitdefender, it shows a clear result. Then I wanted to check at least the exe file with VirusTotal and it showed 3 malicious flags. I also checked the file with Intezer Analyze, it also flagged it as malicious. I asked to discord server of the game, they claimed it is a false positive. I tried to find a sandbox program but saw you guys don't recommend it. I also learned I should check the first time in VT. It seems old but doesn't know what to do with that info. Today, the number of flags are increased to 5 but still no companies like Kaspersky or BitDefender. I saw a little menu in VT> behavior and check things like zenbox, virustotal observer, etc and saw registry actions like :

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\ACPI\DSDT\VBOX__
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Option (this also occurs on legit programs)
These are suspicious, aren't they? I want to learn some basic things about security to use in the future. Is this false positive? What things to look for false positive? what if this came out clean but a file I wouldn't consider scanning was infected? I've already downloaded it, is it a problem? Thank you and forgive me if I am writing in the wrong forum.

I mean, I can't guarantee it is safe, but what you're describing doesn't sound harmful so far. 

I think you're starting to see how VirusTotal can be both good and bad, especially with engines that mostly train themselves on VirusTotal, all it takes is one to flag a false positive before others start following suit.

There was a controversy a while back where I believe Kaspersky would falsely flag things as malware on their VirusTotal engine to sabotage competitors, and it worked."

Oh, I wasn't aware of that. I think I will be checking submission dates to see if it's old and vendors with flags if they are ML or sandbox along with the story of the file so I can get an idea if it's likely or less likely a harmful file. Do you think it is a good habit?
I got ransomware 10-15 years ago and luckily got rid of it with Malwarebytes. I am using Kaspersky free and BitDefender free on my computers nowadays. I don't want any malware again but I don't want to restrict myself too much on the internet too. I might end up trying to learn how to analyze and stuff at the end of the day "

It’s not a bad habit, just a few things to keep in mind:

As I mentioned, some of the beta/research AI engines have a lot of false positives
Most engines have their cloud component turned off, which means they’ll have poor detections. In particular, Microsoft Defender and Avira products (including F-Secure) are more likely to falsely say Clean when the actual product would have detected something via the cloud
Security researchers with special VT accounts can download samples that you upload. So don’t upload anything assuming that it’s private 

I would pay attention to the Kaspersky and ESET results. Those are two of the best static scanners out there and the chances of malware getting past them is very slim."

I received this email this afternoon. Despite knowing it’s most likely a scam, my paranoia is getting the best of me. Just wondering if anyone can help solve this?","Hey Guys, just got this email

""Hi. How are you?I know, it's unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.
Few months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.
Afterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.Here is the history of how it became possible:
At first, I purchased from hackers access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).As result, I could easily access all your email accounts including this one (--------) i am contacting you with.One week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.Frankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).Everything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!
My software enables me with access to control all inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.
Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.As I was gathering information about you, I couldn't help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.
If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues at ---------.I can also make those vids become accessible by public.I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:All you are required to do is a single transfer of $1900 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.
After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.This is really a good deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process - All the necessary information is online.Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below:1Gh64qemDns4AgFdAESDqsYNbA55sCxqex
You should complete the above mentioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:#Do not try replying my email (it was sent from your email address to your email address).#Do not try calling law enforcement and abstain from sharing this story with your friends. If this happens (be sure, I can easily find out, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) or if you dont make payment - your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.#Do not try searching for me - there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.#Do not try deleting evidence from your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to my servers.The following list contains things you should not be worried about:#That your money won't reach my account.- Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, once the transaction is complete, i will be notified I will also know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.- Trust me, it's pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already! I dont know you personallyLet's make this deal in a fair manner!Owh, one more thing...in future it is best that you don't involve yourself in similar situations any longer!One last advice from me - recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.""

Here's everything you need to know about this devastating malware. Spread by spam emails, Emotet's goal was to compromise devices and networks and sell back-door access to anyone. Emotet was much more than just malware. The cybercriminals behind it behaved like a commercial business, offering their weapon for hire to other cybercriminals. This allowed these third parties to install all kinds of malicious software - like banking trojans, ransomware, botnets and cryptocurrency miners - onto their victims' networks. With an estimated clean up cost of $1m per attack, the US Department of Homeland Security concluded Emotet had enormous destructive power. Germany's Federal Office for Information Security called Emotet the ""king of malware.""

There's no question Emotet is one of the most complex and dangerous malware ever. It left a trail of expensive attacks in its wake, partly because it's polymorphic, which means its code changes a little bit every time it's accessed. This made it almost impossible for antivirus software to defeat. Like their code, the cybercriminals behind Emotet were constantly on the move.

Since the beginning of 2020, Dutch and Belgian residents have been increasingly targeted by financially motivated cybercriminals looking to obtain access to their bank accounts. In many strikingly similar cases, fraudsters reach out to victims via email, SMS, or WhatsApp messages to deliver fake notifications containing malicious links pointing to a phishing site. The phishing pages, detected by Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, are almost identical and disguised to look like legitimate banking websites of the biggest local financial organizations with the goal of tricking unsuspecting victims into providing their personal and banking information.

In order to help regular users avoid falling prey to Fraud Family's affiliates, Group-IB team prepared a set of simple recommendations:

Always be cautious and fully aware of anything sent to you, even if you think it may be legitimate.
Do not click on any links that you are not 100% confident are real
Double check the address of a website is the official one before you submit any information
If the link comes from someone you know, confirm with that person using another way of communication
Contact the organization which sent you a link to confirm they have really sent you that message
If in doubt, use services like URLScan or VirusTotal to quickly scan the URL you have been sent, and look for red flags
If you think you may be a victim of a phishing attack, quickly communicate with your bank, the organization being impersonated by the fraudsters and the police. They can issue an alert which may umlimately raise awareness and reduce the victim count
Keep in mind that usually official organizations do not use URL shorteners, so links leading to bit.ly, s.id, tny.sh and others, are very suspicious and you should double check the final destination
Report any identified phishing email or SMS to fraudehelpdesk.nl, scamadviser.com. These reports aid cybersecurity professionals to investigate and take action against fraudulent websites, in addition to helping protect other victims.

","There is little that will save you from spear phishing. If the fraudster approached the matter professionally, then he first learns everything about the target victim so that the phishing email to this particular person seems 100% legitimate, and he will calculate all the actions of the victim that are most likely, take into account all the nuances of this person's psychology. ... And these recommendations will certainly save you from mass phishing. For example, I receive a lot of phishing emails almost every day - these are letters in which it is written that my computer has long been hacked and an unknown hacker has collected hours of movies as I watch movies on porn sites and get excited naked right in front of the webcam, shaking all parts of my body from head to toe  And this despite the fact that I have never visited a porn site in my life  But, despite this, the hacker allegedly asks for, allegedly, compromising almost half a bitcoin, otherwise he will send it to all my friends and acquaintances this video is how I watch porn and shake everything I can and cannot in front of the monitor  Well, let it send it  Also, letters come from girls often, and from girls from all over the world, here is the last letter from some supposedly Norwegian woman  How did the Norwegian know about me - a mystery?  But they really want to meet me. Well, maybe if the ""hacker"" sent them a movie like me shaking naked in front of the monitor with something that should not be shaken, then maybe she would not want to meet me  Well, a lot of other phishing passes - documents from government services, lottery winnings, judging for which I am already a millionaire with Mercedes and an apartment in Moscow, then something related to bitcoins comes, etc. Such massive phishing is not scary, but targeted phishing is scary."

Bottom line: “the AI pipeline led to qualitative improvements by saving manpower and time, speeding up our rate of operations,” said Lin. And for context and content generation, “integrating AI helps to streamline and standardize operations. No longer is the input and output dependent on individual operator’s skill sets and predispositions.” This set-up also allowed the researchers to integrate their infrastructure with other existing tools such as the Gophish open-source phishing framework, Lin continued. “This highlights how AI-as-a-service offers a step up in accessibility from open-source language models,” he noted. The presentation also covered potential defenses against such threats, especially as they continued to evolve.

AI-as-a-service tools craft spear-phishing emails with minimal human input


The researchers found that the AI pipeline was very effective at getting test subjects to not only click on a link, but also fill out a form field.

It’s just a matter of time before this is really effective. Combine it with voice and video synthesis, and you have some pretty scary scenarios. The real risk isn’t that AI-generated phishing emails are as good as human-generated ones, it’s that they can be generated at much greater scale.

"Aug 13, 2021","Ransomware - In the fight against ransomware, Microsoft must do more","


Not a day goes by that I don’t hear about some business or consultant affected by ransomware. Often, the incident starts with a phishing attack or from a vulnerability introduced by delayed patching. Or it could be a consultant tool that should have been coded better. Regardless of how it began, if you attempt to recover from a backup (assuming you have a viable one on hand) or pay the ransom and attempt to unencrypt your data, recovery will take time.

That’s time companies often don’t have.

Last week, the US government set up the Stopransomware website to help businesses, schools, and other organizations deal with ransomware attacks. Included in the guidance are recommendations regarding backing up:

“It is critical to maintain offline, encrypted backups of data and to regularly test your backups. Backup procedures should be conducted on a regular basis. It is important that backups be maintained offline, as many ransomware variants attempt to find and delete any accessible backups. Maintaining offline, current backups is most critical because there is no need to pay a ransom for data that is readily accessible to your organization.

“Maintain regularly updated ‘gold images’ of critical systems in the event they need to be rebuilt. This entails maintaining image ‘templates’ that include a preconfigured operating system (OS) and associated software applications that can be quickly deployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server.

“Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the event rebuilding the primary system is not preferred. Hardware that is newer or older than the primary system can present installation or compatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.

“In addition to system images, applicable source code or executables should be available (stored with backups, escrowed, license agreement to obtain, etc.). It is more efficient to rebuild from system images, but some images will not install on different hardware or platforms correctly; having separate access to needed software will help in these cases.”

In general, the issue of backups is where I feel Microsoft is dropping the ball when it comes to encouraging best practices. To be fair, it does often have to tap dance carefully around the ecosystem of third-party options provided by a number of vendors.

Especially for small businesses and individual users, there’s a divide between the needs of large enterprises versus smaller firms. Large businesses can use such tools as Autopilot to quickly roll out images of new machines for deployment. If, say, a series of workstations is damaged by ransomware, various tools such as AutoPilot can be used to redeploy them. (Windows 11 fully supports AutoPilot and even provides options to join Azure AD in an easy manner.)

For small businesses, Microsoft’s idea of ransomware includes Controlled folder access. Controlled folder access ensures that the following folders are protected from ransomware:

c:\Users\<username>\Documents
c:\Users\Public\Documents
c:\Users\<username>\Pictures
c:\Users\Public\Pictures
c:\Users\Public\Videos
c:\Users\<username>\Videos
c:\Users\<username>\Music
c:\Users\Public\Music
c:\Users\<username>\Favorites

But there’s a catch. This only works when Windows Defender is your main antivirus. If you use any other third-party vendor for antivirus protection, you won’t be able to use this feature.

The next thing Microsoft offers up for ransomware data recovery is to offload files to OneDrive. Unless you have a premium OneDrive account, you’ll be limited as to how much room you have to sync files.

The fly in the ointment
You can see the flaw in these offerings: They don’t urge users to make a gold image of their critical systems. To a home user, or a small business, every desktop is a critical system. Yet Microsoft over the years has moved away from stressing backups to push syncing with cloud services. Show me a small business computer and I guarantee I’ll find some software installed for which you can no longer find the product keys, the software installation file, the installation CD, or lately, a key download from Microsoft’s download servers that’s been removed because it was code-signed with an SHA-1 signature.

Having an exact image of what I have on my computer right now is a key way to ensure I’m protected from ransomware. Yet, Microsoft is moving away from tools to provide this with Windows 11.

Don’t get me wrong. I see cloud storage as a secure way to have yet another set of key files. But if I’ve been hit with ransomware and I need to recover files, it’s going to take hours — if not days — to pull it down from the cloud. Even if I do pay the ransomware and get the key to unencrypt my data, it will still take hours, if not weeks, to undo the damage.

Most small businesses I know don’t run from the cloud or have weeks to recover from attacks. They typically have one or two key servers that provide key needs that can’t be replicated in cloud offerings at this time. There will probably be a time when all of my small business software offerings will be in the cloud and I no longer need a local server, but today is not that day. Even larger businesses are still very much dependent on our active directory domain infrastructure.

How to make a ‘gold image’
In Windows 10, to prepare a gold image you have to use a deprecated backup tool left over from Windows 7 — the System Image Backup tool. To enable the tool, go to Settings, then click on Update & Security, then click on Backup. Under the ""Looking for an older backup?"" section, click the Go to Backup and Restore (Windows 7) option.

What are your options in Windows 11? Under Accounts>Windows backup, you’re prompted to set up OneDrive folder syncing, to remember my apps across my devices, and to remember my preferences across all of my devices. But many users have one – and only one – Windows computer; there is no other device to recover to unless you purchase another PC. Your other option is to save files to another drive. Once again, you have to rely on deprecated software(hiding in an old control panel setting) that Microsoft no longer supports to have an image of your computer as recommended as by the US government ransomware guidance.

Once upon a time, Microsoft specifically designed software for small businesses. In its first iteration of software for SMBs, the company included a wizard to set up backups because many firms forgot to do so. That setup included a notification email showing whether a backup was successful or failed. In a later project geared toward home users, Microsoft built a wizard that not only backed up everything, but easily set up workstation backups for each computer joined on the peer-to-peer network.

Now, the built-in options are either backup to the cloud or make copies of files. Like Windows 10, options are limited. Microsoft says Windows 11 will be the most secure platform ever. But we need to take a step back and ensure that Windows 11 can be easily recovered. We know attackers will find new ways to launch attacks. So, ensuring we can recover means we can deal with anything.

Microsoft can do better than this. Recovery from ransomware should be Job 1 right now. In the meantime, join us at Askwoody.com as we discuss the various ways to backup our machines. It’s too important to wait for Microsoft to act, so make sure you plan ahead and know your options.

There will probably be a time when all of my small business software offerings will be in the cloud and I no longer need a local server, but today is not that day. Even larger businesses are still very much dependent on our active directory domain infrastructure.

How to make a ‘gold image’
In Windows 10, to prepare a gold image you have to use a deprecated backup tool left over from Windows 7 — the System Image Backup tool. To enable the tool, go to Settings, then click on Update & Security, then click on Backup. Under the ""Looking for an older backup?"" section, click the Go to Backup and Restore (Windows 7) option.

What are your options in Windows 11? Under Accounts>Windows backup, you’re prompted to set up OneDrive folder syncing, to remember my apps across my devices, and to remember my preferences across all of my devices. But many users have one – and only one – Windows computer; there is no other device to recover to unless you purchase another PC. Your other option is to save files to another drive. Once again, you have to rely on deprecated software(hiding in an old control panel setting) that Microsoft no longer supports to have an image of your computer as recommended as by the US government ransomware guidance.

Once upon a time, Microsoft specifically designed software for small businesses. In its first iteration of software for SMBs, the company included a wizard to set up backups because many firms forgot to do so. That setup included a notification email showing whether a backup was successful or failed. In a later project geared toward home users, Microsoft built a wizard that not only backed up everything, but easily set up workstation backups for each computer joined on the peer-to-peer network.

Now, the built-in options are either backup to the cloud or make copies of files. Like Windows 10, options are limited. Microsoft says Windows 11 will be the most secure platform ever. But we need to take a step back and ensure that Windows 11 can be easily recovered. We know attackers will find new ways to launch attacks. So, ensuring we can recover means we can deal with anything.

Microsoft can do better than this. Recovery from ransomware should be Job 1 right now. In the meantime, join us at Askwoody.com as we discuss the various ways to backup our machines. It’s too important to wait for Microsoft to act, so make sure you plan ahead and know your options.

In the fight against ransomware, Microsoft must do more


The rash of ransomware attacks that have plagued companies in recent months highlights the need for Microsoft to do more to help users avoid being hit — and recover quickly if they are.

","

Yes. To the ransomware algorithm it's nothing more than a file or folder, it won't care about encryption. It just sees a file, folder or block of digits that can be moved, renamed etc... You can encrypt an encrypted folder 900 times over manually if you wish. It is like adding a lock, on top off a lock while locking those locks over and over and over until you get tired of collecting the individual keys."
"Aug 13, 2021","Ransomware - In the fight against ransomware, Microsoft must do more","


Not a day goes by that I don’t hear about some business or consultant affected by ransomware. Often, the incident starts with a phishing attack or from a vulnerability introduced by delayed patching. Or it could be a consultant tool that should have been coded better. Regardless of how it began, if you attempt to recover from a backup (assuming you have a viable one on hand) or pay the ransom and attempt to unencrypt your data, recovery will take time.

That’s time companies often don’t have.

Last week, the US government set up the Stopransomware website to help businesses, schools, and other organizations deal with ransomware attacks. Included in the guidance are recommendations regarding backing up:

“It is critical to maintain offline, encrypted backups of data and to regularly test your backups. Backup procedures should be conducted on a regular basis. It is important that backups be maintained offline, as many ransomware variants attempt to find and delete any accessible backups. Maintaining offline, current backups is most critical because there is no need to pay a ransom for data that is readily accessible to your organization.

“Maintain regularly updated ‘gold images’ of critical systems in the event they need to be rebuilt. This entails maintaining image ‘templates’ that include a preconfigured operating system (OS) and associated software applications that can be quickly deployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server.

“Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the event rebuilding the primary system is not preferred. Hardware that is newer or older than the primary system can present installation or compatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.

“In addition to system images, applicable source code or executables should be available (stored with backups, escrowed, license agreement to obtain, etc.). It is more efficient to rebuild from system images, but some images will not install on different hardware or platforms correctly; having separate access to needed software will help in these cases.”

In general, the issue of backups is where I feel Microsoft is dropping the ball when it comes to encouraging best practices. To be fair, it does often have to tap dance carefully around the ecosystem of third-party options provided by a number of vendors.

Especially for small businesses and individual users, there’s a divide between the needs of large enterprises versus smaller firms. Large businesses can use such tools as Autopilot to quickly roll out images of new machines for deployment. If, say, a series of workstations is damaged by ransomware, various tools such as AutoPilot can be used to redeploy them. (Windows 11 fully supports AutoPilot and even provides options to join Azure AD in an easy manner.)

For small businesses, Microsoft’s idea of ransomware includes Controlled folder access. Controlled folder access ensures that the following folders are protected from ransomware:

c:\Users\<username>\Documents
c:\Users\Public\Documents
c:\Users\<username>\Pictures
c:\Users\Public\Pictures
c:\Users\Public\Videos
c:\Users\<username>\Videos
c:\Users\<username>\Music
c:\Users\Public\Music
c:\Users\<username>\Favorites

But there’s a catch. This only works when Windows Defender is your main antivirus. If you use any other third-party vendor for antivirus protection, you won’t be able to use this feature.

The next thing Microsoft offers up for ransomware data recovery is to offload files to OneDrive. Unless you have a premium OneDrive account, you’ll be limited as to how much room you have to sync files.

The fly in the ointment
You can see the flaw in these offerings: They don’t urge users to make a gold image of their critical systems. To a home user, or a small business, every desktop is a critical system. Yet Microsoft over the years has moved away from stressing backups to push syncing with cloud services. Show me a small business computer and I guarantee I’ll find some software installed for which you can no longer find the product keys, the software installation file, the installation CD, or lately, a key download from Microsoft’s download servers that’s been removed because it was code-signed with an SHA-1 signature.

Having an exact image of what I have on my computer right now is a key way to ensure I’m protected from ransomware. Yet, Microsoft is moving away from tools to provide this with Windows 11.

Don’t get me wrong. I see cloud storage as a secure way to have yet another set of key files. But if I’ve been hit with ransomware and I need to recover files, it’s going to take hours — if not days — to pull it down from the cloud. Even if I do pay the ransomware and get the key to unencrypt my data, it will still take hours, if not weeks, to undo the damage.

Most small businesses I know don’t run from the cloud or have weeks to recover from attacks. They typically have one or two key servers that provide key needs that can’t be replicated in cloud offerings at this time. There will probably be a time when all of my small business software offerings will be in the cloud and I no longer need a local server, but today is not that day.

Very recently I had the chance to test it. I just can't believe how light this AV is! On idle, RAM usage is <45MB and I feel no effect of system performance being dragged down, in fact it is faster!

"Jun 18, 2022",User Feedback - K7 Total security,Insanely light antivirus,"Agree, super light AV, decent signatures (at least for .exe, not so for scriptors and office files).
BB is also very reactive, seems to not rely on the cloud like many other products (works offline, too).
Lacking in terms of Ransomware Protection though (it does have DataLocker though, which prevents file encryption for covered folders - by default documents, pictures - by 98%, during my testing in the HUB, in very rare cases RW bypassed folder protection).
And sometimes HIPS does not recognize new AutoRuns (for example by scriptors), it did sometimes remove them after 20-30 minutes, not that stable yet.
But in most cases, you should be safe, even more as usually malware does not tend to pop up in bunches on the local machine like in the HUB tests, but rather takes the way via the browser, where K7 Web protection shines (at least for malware links).

EDIT: I really dislike there seems to be no option to ask for outbound by trusted M$ processes, even in highest settings (apart from block everything), they're whitelisted on outbound attempt.
Better create your own list for (later hollowed) Windows .exe you don't want to see call outbound.
All other services are ask first as intended (if you change firewall behaviour to do so, by default it doesn't).

kaspersky is overrated, and outperformed in many tests by antiviruses like Avast, so I don't know if it's that good. The antivirus that changed to Avira is because it is ""lighter"" but not because it is better. Bullguard changed to Avira because it was acquired by Norton. And f-secure switched to Avira to lighten it up a bit. Greetings. What happens is that those who use only the bitdefender engine do not use their technologies like photon, that's why they become heavy.

"May 19, 2022",User Feedback - F-Secure SAFE 18.2,One of the lightest AVs I've ever tested.,"Thanks to the three-year giveaway, I have been testing F-Secure SAFE 18.2 over the last few days. 

Compared with my previous experience with F-Secure, I see significant improvements in terms of DeepGuard and F-Secure Security Cloud. 

DeepGuard, an effective behavior blocker, successfully blocked the so-called Coffee Ransomware, which Comodo, Kaspersky's SW, HitmanPro Alert, ESET, Bitdefender's ATD, and Symantec's SONAR failed to block when the threat was not yet added to their Virus Database, indicating that DeepGuard is better than other well-known BBs in some cases. However, DeepGuard is not perfect. It was unable to block the Remcos malware and some PowerShell script malwares in my testing. In addition, I hope DeepGuard will be able to roll back any changes made by malware in the future.

F-Secure Security Cloud, F-Secure's equivalent of Kaspersky's KSN and ESET's LiveGrid, has done a very good job at detecting new malwares that Avira engine failed to detect. Its detection rate has improved. However, unlike KSN and LiveGrid, we cannot check the files' reputations in F-Secure Security Cloud.

The biggest shortcoming of F-Secure is its VERY SLOW response to users' sample submissions. In my experience, F-Secure's analyst replied my submission after five days, saying the files I submitted were malicious and had been blocked by F-Secure Security Cloud for immediate protection (???). But, as the C&C server is down, this sample actually does no harm when it was blocked by F-Secure Security Cloud ."

F-Secure blocks phishing and harmful websites with its browser plug-in. However, in my testing, F-Secure was unable to block as many harmful websites as McAfee WebAdvisor. Because some phishing sites are difficult to detect, failing to block them isn't a big deal. What disappoints me about F-Secure's surf protection is that even after I submitted the URLs for analysis, it was unable to block those sites until they were down. In contrast, McAfee WebAdvisor responds to my URL submission within one hour, and Norton SafeWeb responds immediately if its automatic system is able to classify."

"May 19, 2022",User Feedback - F-Secure SAFE 18.2,One of the lightest AVs I've ever tested.,"

If so, F-Secure should remove the Submit A Sample site, and ask submitter to send their samples through official community, just like Malwarebytes. "
"May 19, 2022",User Feedback - F-Secure SAFE 18.2,One of the lightest AVs I've ever tested.,"Very well written and I agree with your feedback. DeepGuard is probably the most interesting part of F-Secure and it's one of the most effective BB's out there. I agree that all of its engines have a bit of a weak spot against script based malware, and DeepGuard in particular is very weak if you exploit something they overzealously whitelisted. (For example the last time I tested, various things like 7Zip, MATLAB, official and portable Python, and Node.JS / Chromium V8 are all completely whitelisted. You can easily build ransomware or even run stock malware with those, and DeepGuard won't say a thing unless your malware is stupid enough to download a secondary payload that gets flagged). On the other end of the spectrum, DeepGuard can have a lot of false alarms with certain software. In another thread, we analyzed that for something like Rufus which tries to disable USB drive autorun dialogs via GPO, if you change the hash of the app at all, DeepGuard thinks that it's a GPO trojan.

They don't seem to focus on either proper cleanup or rollback. A lot of partial hits result in DeepGuard repeatedly flagging an AutoRun on every boot. KSW and other BB's combine almost as strong performance with a pretty elaborate rollback mechanism.

Overall though it's still one of my favorite lightweight AVs. It's small, unintrusive, and tastefully uses a lot of native Windows features like notifications without bothering you all the time. It's probably my favorite drop in replacement for Windows Defender for those who just want an AV that gets out of their way."
"May 19, 2022",User Feedback - F-Secure SAFE 18.2,One of the lightest AVs I've ever tested.,"

I evaluated them in the sense that they are proactive in responding to users.

As for the fact that it takes longer time than other vendors to determine and reflect suspicious files, I suspect that the support desk and the technical department are not well coordinated.

You can install it without real-time protection, the AV will work as a on demand scanner only. Not sure about the other modules.

CFW and Comodo do have a lot of things that can go wrong mind, when Forticlient blocks a site it may do so sufficiently. Depends if this bug has been fixed or you have experienced this.

1. The use of RAM should not be used to determine whether an AV is light or heavy.

I understand what you mean. There's no 'huge' reason to give 5 stars or consider using TM. @Claudio66 said almost the same things I just wanna say. I don't want to test malware samples anymore, I don't enter dangerous website. I already know RAM doesn't directly affect user experience (bitdefender put its signature on the RAM for example), but TM has evolved in various sides except low RAM. You could read my configuration thread(Advanced Security - safetrend laptop Configuration 2022), threre's my user experience of other products. TM may not be the 'best' product, but it's made the least problem on my system. That's the reason I use it and gave 5 stars.

MS Defender is not on my consideration for similar reasons. My old laptop gets slow down and exprienced some FP when using WD. Above all, WD looks UGLY to me."

Yes. this one. There are so-called 'traditional' AV Vendors like Bitdefender, Mcafee and Trendmicro plus Corporate/Business Only Vendors like SentinelOne or Cybereason.

A G Data continues with Bitdefender because it knows it's the best option, they don't need the Avira subscription to become better, the security modules are many and effective, in addition to Bitdefender they have their own engine (ClosedGap), they have the cloud , behavior blocker (one of the best on the market) and the DeepRay protection that when I tested it on the HUB proved to be very strong and active, G Data is a solid company, they don't mess with the team that is winning.

And always in my tests Bitdefender subscriptions were faster than Avira. That is, it makes no sense to leave a company that is one of the best in the world to go to another that has always been in decline and that was bought by another security company not for its potential, but for the number of fixed customers for the brand, Avira has unfortunately become a very bad security product and no light at the end of the tunnel."

I tried Norton 360 today and it defragmented my SSD, it wasnt a TRIM, it took something between 12 minutes to complete, I almost sure it was a bug, this shouldnt have happened.

If I am not wrong all Norton does is call Windows API, but this interaction went wrong in my machine.

Exactly the same thing happened with me a couple of months back when I used Norton. For some reason it can't differentiate between SSD and HDD. Defragmenting a SSD is detrimental to it's lifespan. When I disabled the automatic tasks from Norton I found out that it had also disabled the windows built-in disk optimizer (which was then configured by Norton to never run)."

About Norton Premium/360: They still send trials to Norton Premium? I think they only keep Norton 360, maybe that's why you are getting pop ups to change to Norton 360.

Yes. As you saw, my experience was really bad. I uninstalled Norton cause those 2 false positives it found were sites that i use a lot. So if i wanted to keep it, i'd have to face Norton blocking those pages all the time - as Norton doesn't offer any way to exclude those pages from the signatures. 

All comments i did were based on experiences that can be evaluated in that time. For example, the installation process, the management of configs, and - surprisingly - finding 2 FP in 1 day.

BTW, i made clear that my experience is limited to that period.

Actually it isn't. I meant it was running in background even after closing the browser. All those browser i mentioned were minimized for that bottom bar with norton, day, sound. etc... after closing the browsers. The only extensions i've ever saw with this behaviour were VPN extensions (meant to keep the VPN access 100% of time with the installed browser) and Norton extensions.

Other extensions like Kaspersky protection, Bitdefender TrafficLight, Htttps everywhere, ublock, etc, are only loaded when (and during) the browser is in use.

I think that a paid AV shouldn't even consider telling you to use their search engine ""because it's safer"". Its probably as safe as using google or any other. Maybe it will exclude some pishing pages from the query, but thats why you already have SmartScreen, SafeBrowsing and the Norton web defense itself (without mentioning MBGD, BTLS, etc). The only true reason they ask you to use their search engine is to make more profit with you, by tracking your web habits. So basically you are paying to use their service and to see them asking you to track your search - and send more information ""anonymously -, so they can make more money with you. I don't think it's ethical, and i would not trust a company that tries to explore its users in every way they can find.

I never intended to make a ""final judge"" about Norton after one day.

I think that pointing those problems, even if some people don't agree, could help other users to check them and make their own opinion.

You buy BitDefender from your local store/shop/local country Amazon or ebay.

You don't know whether that's a global license or a regional one.

Personally I prefer a FP that I can easily bypass if I'm 100% sure the file is safe, than an Infected system. FPs are not an issue if you know that file is safe a few clicks and add to exception and you on your way without much hassle.

Compared to the process of getting infected and then cleaning you whole OS. I rather have an FP any-day compared to an infected OS.

Well, according to the others ESET has an excellent detection of pot. unwanted applications. It is not clear based on what you've made such statement. Also it's not clear what you mean by maximum protection; setting the detection level to aggressive should not increase the number of PUA FPs.




4 - it is not so automatic, sometimes requiring user interaction, which is not good for the lay user.

Cleaning is fully automatic. Basically only if there is a system file infected with a non-cleanable virus the user should be prompted for an action. This is because automatic deletion of such file could render the OS non-functional.

The differences in tests are very minimal when it comes to missed malware. However, in terms of false positives and performance, ESET is typically in top 3 if not the first.

1 - yes, pup detection is excellent only when the secure application module is activated, which increases the number of false positives and considers legitimate installers such as utorrent as a threat.

2 - Self-respecting antivirus should not ask for user intervention, Bitdefender does not ask under any circumstances. Kaspersky also does not delete files from the system but is less intrusive than ESET.

3 - This minimal difference makes all the difference in the long run, first-tier Antivirus stays on top of the tests constantly and not only in isolated tests, Yes Eset is only good in false positive tests. In that he is incredible.

4 - Eset's Web filter is good but it is already inferior to Bitdefender and Kaspersky, even Malware bytes is better.

I have not used this product before, but now I already have a certain idea about it. A fairly easy product for system resources compared to the antiviruses that I used before (I had Avast for 6 years, then free Kaspersky for a year, then paid for another year, and again free for half a year). A couple of times Eset blocked my access to sites (he defined one site as malicious, the other site as containing PUPs). In fact, the ""dangerous"" site does not contain any dangerous things  I calmly entered it from other PCs and read articles there (this is a site on computer security, programs, settings, in general about computers and the Internet). But the site is included in the internal blacklist of Eset and Eset is not allowed there in any way, even if it is included in the exceptions  Perhaps this is all that Eset web protection has remembered for a year 
The antivirus did not deliver any global problems in a year of use.
It is definitely disappointing that some of the stagnation in development that other users have noted is disappointing. So, for example, the LiveGuard function was introduced only in the premium version, and the new version of Internet Security was left without new functions at all. The developers are clearly trolling users when the award received from AV-Comparatives in 2020 is indicated as a new function for the antivirus Internet Security. 
It is also disappointing that the ""Network Inspector"" is designated as a ""new"" function for Internet Security version 15, while this very name ""Network Inspector"" has already appeared in version 14, and has already performed the same functions. Although, the official forum has already written the position of the developers that they think that users almost never look at the interface. It turns out that you can write that a new function was introduced, although in fact it has been around for a long time 
Once again, there is nothing to say about HIPS. Everything has already been said on the official forum, here on the forum, and more than once.

Blocking a url by the internal blacklist can be overridden by adding the domain (with a leading/trailing asterisk) to the list of allowed websites in the URL management setup. However, we don't recommend this unless you report the url to ESET and get a confirmation that the website has been cleaned and will be unblocked.

The confirmation I received now from Virustotal, where ESET designates this site as secure. It is all the more surprising why it blocks it on the local system. Perhaps ESET detects some individual scripts on the site or something else, but it completely blocks access to the site, and not to some of its separate parts, although the site itself is classified as safe (judging by its own detection on Virustotal). All information in the screenshot.

HIPS as well as other components, such as the Deep Behavior Inspection are continually being improved and updated through automatic module updates. However, behavioral detection improvements and other module changes are not communicated as prominently as program changes when a new version is unveiled.

Although I have not previously used the ESET antivirus, however, I have been watching all the videos with antivirus testing on the COMSS website since 2013. ESET is being tested as well, and you can even look at the full selection of ESET tests, starting from 2013. The last test was two months ago. The version of Endpoint was tested 
Internet Security version 14 was tested exactly one year ago, in November 2020. In this case, you can compare the work of HIPS 7-9 years ago and now. I noticed that earlier the work of HIPS was noticeable, the antivirus reacted to the launch of suspicious programs with a large number of HIPS alerts, but in the tests in recent years there was not a single HIPS reaction to the launch of a large number of suspicious programs. And this is noticed not only by me, but also by other users. Perhaps the developers decided that alerts would scare unprepared users, or that users may misunderstand and infect the system by clicking the Allow option, therefore, they reduced the number of preset rules in HIPS, at the same time making them unavailable for viewing by the user (so that especially curious users could not dig deeper, and inexperienced users could not harm themselves). But as a result, we see that HIPS practically stopped responding to anything. If I hadn't written the rules myself, I wouldn't have seen a single alert in a year.
In particular, one more point is not clear to me with HIPS. The developers themselves recommend writing several rules in HIPS to improve protection against ransomware. [KB6119] Configure HIPS rules for ESET business products to protect against ransomware (8.x) Yes, this is recommended for business users. But don't home users suffer from ransomware? On the contrary, I think that home users suffer from ransomware no less than corporate users.
Here, on this forum, ESET was also tested. With and without recommended HIPS guidelines. And protection with prescribed rules is almost 100%, and without prescribed recommended rules - much lower.
Why can't developers make an option in HIPS in the form of a toggle that would activate the rules recommended by the developers themselves to protect against ransomware with one click of the user? Call it, for example, ""Enhanced protection against ransomware"" or something else  Are the developers afraid that this will lead to problems for users? Of course, I cannot speak for all users, but for myself I can. I wrote these rules right away, and for a year there was not a single problem when installing any programs and other actions. However, I registered in the rules the action is not a Block, but a Question to the user. But there was not a single alert (except for alerts about other rules). If there are fears of blocking, then let there be an action - a question to the user. Let's admit this option, which activates this set of HIPS rules, will be inactive by default (disable rules), but when installing the antivirus, the user will be prompted to enable it, as it is suggested with the PUP detection option. And the user will decide whether he needs it or not. Is it technically impossible to do this?"

Yes, I have written the HIPS and firewall rules recommended by the developers. Added rules to them to protect autorun and hosts file, as well as some registry keys. Also added rules to protect folders of Documents, Music, Videos, Images, in general, for folders with personal files. In Runet, as far as I know, there are ready-made sets of rules for HIPS ESET with 200-300 or more rules prescribed."

Been a while I tried Bitdefender last time, but I suspect its the Bitdefender engine just getting more and more absurdly demanding. Yes, it has good behavior blocker. It doesn't have bad protection. But there are others that use significantly less resources and provide equal or better protection... Your security software should not be using this much resources imo. Still, I'll give it 3 stars and that's me being generous. After all, there are much worse products out there too. I just would not use it personally.

Most of your negative points are connected to this issue (a few copied above). Have you tried reinstalling the client and/or turning on Memory Usage Optimization to see if there was a difference in RAM usage? And how much, if there was.

(Though I must mention, I never experienced any issues with EAM while gaming.)

If you're in need of extensive features and a UI that comes with that, instead of the lovely UI Emsisoft offers (in my opinion), than this product is simply not for you. In that case the competition might be more up your alley like for example Eset, Bitdefender or Kaspersky to name a few… Competitors with more opt-in features.

My computers have not been infected for at least a decade. I ran Windows 7 back in the day without any AV and actually never did get infected... It all comes down to safe computing habits, not installing unknown software or software from unknown sources and using a couple browser extensions to harden your browser. 

Emsisoft behavior blocker was probably just monitoring multiple running applications at same time... Hence why I'm not really fan of behavior blockers in the first place. When you know proper browsing habits + use proper adblocker the attack surface is already considerably reduced. I also block all 3rd party cookies on all of my browsers... Only downloading and installing software from official sources as well. If someone shared me an installer of any particular software, I would not run it even if my AV or VirusTotal did not detect anything. I'd still download that particular software's installer from the official source. Most malware gets through from malicious ads, by blocking them you already blocked majority of the threats imo. Another major source for malware are e-mail attachments... So again, don't go open those attachments from unknown senders.

That performance hogging was obviously just flawed design from Emsisoft's part. Malwarebytes and HitmanPro scans come always clean. Emsisoft was just busy being resource hog and monitoring legitimate applications. This is exactly why I never liked this software. Bitdefender engine in general is a buggy performance hogging mess as well. F-Secure improved instantly their product after switching over to Avira engine...

Personally I keep basically flip flopping between Windows Defender and ESET Internet Security cause I find them to be the only non intrusive ones. I end up always concluding it isn't worth paying for ESET, yet I do prefer it over WD. Its just WD is already more than enough protection for experienced user. Who knows, maybe I'll end up wasting money for ESET license simply cause I do appreciate the efficient coding behind it. Mind you, I always disable HTTPS scanning/certificate on ESET. I think that is utterly pointless and no AV should go breaking HTTPS standard.

Contrary to popular belief here, I think ESET is taking the right route by not having a proper behavior blocker. BB is like an annoying nanny for experienced users. HIPS can be configured to be just as effective if not more so, without any added performance penalty that would come with fully fledged behavior blocker. And signatures are often overlooked - they are the surest way to catch a malware, and it just so happens ESET signatures are top notch as well. Point being, you don't have to be a resource hogging mess to provide excellent protection."
